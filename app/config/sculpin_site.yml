      The course was very informative. One of the biggest pain points with Drupal testing was that there was no clear and definitive guide on setting up the php unit XML file to get functional and kernel tests working right away. Your guide was fantastic and I will definitely be using it going forward in my module development for work.

      Hi Oliver, we met briefly at the Tech Connect event in London last month. Been reading through a few of your latest posts and have found the messages valuable, especially as we spent the week learning about unit, integration and e2e testing. I have signed up to your mailing list to keep the good advice flowing!

      I had the opportunity and good fortune to work with Oliver solving two problems that I was having on a Drupal Commerce site.    I have done several Drupal sites using UberCart, but since it is deprecated, I chose to use Commerce. I had searched, posted to forums, and other normal means to find answers to my problems, to no response and to no avail.

      I got a referral to Oliver and scheduled an appointment to discuss the problems on a Zoom call. After showing him via screen share where I was stumped, he offered different approaches to what I was doing, which I was fine with as long as it worked.

      Once we solved the first problem, I was really elated and then focused on the second one, which was an easier fix.    So in a short period of time, both problems were fixed and tested.

      I found Oliver was affable and easy to work with.    He has a strong work ethic and a desire to solve problems for his customers and can recommend working with him.    I think one of his strengths is to find alternative solutions to problems.

      I am a big fan of your git approaches. I especially remember pairing with you and watching how many commands you run to solve many problems and how fast you were. It's a skill I believe not many have, particularly those who are used to working with a GUI like me, and personally I think it is quite valuable.

      I've wanted to explore testing for a while, but as a PHP developer with 10 years of Drupal experience who'd written next to no tests, I really needed guidance. Oliver's expertise in testing and TDD motivated me to seek his help.

      Before our call, I'd started writing tests for my modules but needed direction, understanding the code to a degree but needing help with approach. Oliver clarified both unit and integration testing, providing solutions for my challenges, and shared his code for inspiration and help. He also gave me ideas on how to utilise contrib code to help me further.

      Consulting with an expert, I gained the clarity and confidence I needed in tackling testing with structured, maintainable practices. Oliver's adaptability and tailored services make him highly recommendable.

      Thanks, Oliver - I feel empowered and know exactly what approach to take now!

      I've worked with Oliver for a number of years on B2C and B2B web projects and he has always demonstrated himself to be an expert in his field.

      As an insurance provider, some of our products and services don't naturally fit within a traditional ecommerce journey - but Oliver has always been able to come up with innovative ways to leverage core Drupal functionality and develop custom modules to meet our needs.

      Friendly, flexible and diligent - I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Oliver to anyone looking for a Drupal developer to progress their next project.

      We use Oliver for maintaining a couple of Drupal sites for which we no longer have the skills ourselves. We became aware of Oliver through his work in the Drupal community, and about a year ago we approached him to help us with the deep dive aspects of maintaining and developing Drupal sites. He's been really helpful and very responsive. Much appreciated!

      For over a decade we have worked with Oliver on a number of different projects. Initially our collaboration consisted of web maintenance and troubleshooting but we soon tapped Oliver to design, build and maintain a custom awards site which includes both submission and judging functionality. Oliver has deep and wide-ranging skills and I would certainly recommend his services!

      Working with Oliver on the Seren website has been easy and beneficial.

      As well as providing general maintenance support, he built a new Drupal module which integrated with our partners Glassboxx so that we could sell ebooks directly from our website. Oliver worked closely with the team at Glassboxx to create the integration which needed to communicate with the Glassboxx app so that users could download their purchases. He was able to resolve issues which came up along the way in order to create a functioning module which we now use on our site.

      Oliver has extensive knowledge of Drupal and his familiarity with the Seren site meant he was able to fix problems quickly and efficiently as they arose.

      He is reliable and has always been willing to discuss new ideas for how the site could function.

      We would recommend working with him for his invaluable knowledge and ability to find solutions to problems at short notice. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the years.

      We have only worked together for a short while but I can see Oliver is a Drupal expert.

      His technical knowledge means we have been able to make improvements to the sites we manage quickly and efficiently.

      If we have complex issues to contend with in the future I feel confident he will be able to deal with them.

      I had the pleasure of working with Oliver whilst building the first version of our drupal based intranet. His knowledge of Drupal and the wider infrastructure required to run a site was really invaluable.

      At the time, we were very new to Drupal, so it gave us a great platform to learn from and expand our own knowledge.

      He's the only external contractor that we've kept in touch with over the years, which goes to show how much we valued his input.
