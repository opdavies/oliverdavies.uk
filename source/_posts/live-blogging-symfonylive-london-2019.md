Inspired by [Matt Stauffer](https://twitter.com/stauffermatt)'s
[live blogging of the keynote](https://mattstauffer.com/blog/introducing-laravel-vapor)
at Laracon US, I’m going to do the same for the sessions that I’m attending at
[SymfonyLive London 2019](https://london2019.live.symfony.com)...

## Keynote (Back to the basics)

**Embrace the Linux philosophy**

- How we grow the Symfony ecosystem. Built abstracts.
- HttpFoundation, HttpKernel
- Moved to infrastructure
- A few abstractions on top of PHP. Improved versions of PHP functions (`dump`
  and `var_dump`)
- Started a add higher level abstractions (e.g. Mailer), built on the lower
  ones.
- Recently worked on PHPUnit assertions. Mailer in Symony 4.4. Can test if an
  email is sent or queued

**Building flexible high-level abstractions on top of low-level ones**

### What's next?

- Mailer announced in London last year. New component.
- System emails? e.g. new customer, new invoice.
- Symfony Mailer = Built-in responsive, flexible, and generic system emails
  - Twig with TwigExtraBundle
  - Twig `inky-extra` package (Twig 1.12+)
  - Zurb Foundation for Emails CSS stylesheet
  - Twig `cssinliner-extra` package (Twig 1.12+)
  - Optimised Twig layouts
- `SystemEmail` class extends templated email
- Can set importance,
- Customisable
- Always trying to keep flexible, so things can be overidden and customised

### Sending SMS messages

- new `Texter` and `SmsMessage` class for sending SMS messages
- Same abstraction as emails, but for SMS messages
- Based on HttpClient + Symfony Messenger and third-party providers (Twilio and
  Nexmo) `twilio://` and `nemxo://`
- Can set via transport `$sms->setTransport('nexmo')`
- Extend the `SystemEmail` and do what you want
- Failover

### Sending Messages

- Create `ChatMessage`
- Telegram and Slack
- `$message->setTransport('telegram')`, `$bus->dispatch($message)`
- Send to Slack **and** Telegram
- `SlackOptions` and `TelegramOptions` for adding emojis etc
- Common transport layer `TransportInterface`, `MessageInterface`
- Failover - e.g. if Twilio is down, send to Telegram

### New component - SymfonyNotifier

- Channels - email, SMS, chat
- Transport, slack, telegram, twilio
- Create a notification, arguments are message and transports (array)
- Receiver
- Customise notifications, `InvoiceNotification` extends `Notification`.
  `getChannels`
  - Override default rendering
  - `ChatNotificationInterface` - `asChatMessage()`
- Semantic configuration
  - `composer req twilio-notifier telegram-notifier`
- Channels
  - Mailer
  - Chatter
  - Texter
  - Browser
  - Pusher (iOS, Android, Desktop native notifications)
  - Database (web notification centre)
  - **A unified way to notify Users via a unified Transport layer**
- Each integration is only 40 lines of code

### What about a SystemNotification?

- Autoconfigured channels
- `new SystemNotification`, `Notifier::getSystemReceivers`
- Importance, automatically configures channels
- Different channels based on importance
- `ExceptionNotification` - get email with stack trace attached

Notifier

- send messages via a unified api
- send to one or many receivers
- Default configu or custom one

### How can we leverage this new infrastructure?

- `Monolog NotifierHandler` - triggered on `Error` level logs
- Uses notified channel configuration
- Converts Error level logs to importance levels
- Configurablelike other Notifications
- 40 lines of code
- Failed Messages Listener - 10 lines of glue code

- **Experimental component in 5.0**
- Can't in in 4.4 as it's a LTS version
- First time an experimental component is added
- Stable in 5.1

## Queues, busses and the Messenger component (Tobias Nyholm)

- Stack is top and buttom - Last-in, first-out
- Queue is back and front - last in, first out

### 2013

- Using Symfony, used 40 or 50 bundles in a project - too much information!
- Used to copy and paste, duplicate a lot of code
- Testing your controllers - controllers as services?
- Controllers are 'comfortable'
- Tried adding `CurrentUserProvider` service to core, should be passed as an
  argument. Cannot test.
- 'Having Symfony all over the place wasn't the best thing' - when to framework
  (Matthias Noback)
  - Hexagonal architecture
  - Keep your kernel away from infrastructure. Let the framework handle the
    infrastructure.
- Controller -> Command -> Command Bus -> `CommandHandler`

#### What did we win?

- Can leverage Middleware with a command bus
- Queues as a service (RabbitMQ)
- Work queue - one producer, multiple consumers
- Queues should be durable - messages are also stored on disk, consumers should
  acknowledge a message once a message is handled
- Publish/subscribe
  - Producer -> Fanout/direct with routing (multiple queues) -> multiple
    consumers
- Topics - wildcards

### 2016

- New intern. Understand everything, 'just PHP'. Plain PHP application, not
  'scary Symfony'

### Symfony Messenger

- `composer req symfony/messager` - best MessageBus implementation
- Message -> Message bus -> Message handler
- Message is a plain PHP class
- Handler is a normal PHP class which is invokable
- `messenger:message_hander` tag in config
- Autowire with `MessageHandlerInterface`
- What if it takes 20 seconds to send a message? Use asynchronous.
- Transports as middleware (needs sender, receiver, configurable with DSN,
  encode/decode). `MESSENGER_DSN` added to `.env`
- Start consumer with `bin/console messager:consume-messages`. Time limit with
  `--time-limit 300`
- PHP Enqueue - production ready, battle-tested messaging solution for PHP

### Issues

- Transformers, takes an object and transforms into an array -
  `FooTransformer implements TransformerInterface`.
- Don't break other apps by changing the payload.

#### Multiple buses

- Command bus, query bus, event bus
- Separate actions from reactions

#### Envelope

- Stamps for metadata - has the item been on the queue already?

#### Failures

- Requeue, different queue or same queue after a period of time
- Failed queue 1 every minute, failed queue 2 every hour - temporary glitches or
  a bug?

#### Creating entities

- What if two users registered at the same tiem? Use uuids rather than IDs.
- Symfony validation - can be used on messages, not just forms.

- Cache everything

  - Option 1: HTTP request -> Thin app (gets responses from Redis) -> POST to
    queue. Every GET request would warm cache
  - Option 2: HTTP request -> Thin app -> return 200 response -> pass to workers

- Tip: put Command and CommandHandlers in the same directory

## HttpClient (Nicolas Grekas)

- new symfony component, released in may
- Httpclient contracts, separate package that contains interfaces
  - Symfony
  - PHP-FIG
  - Httplug
- `HttpClient::create()`. `$client->get()`
- JSON decoded with error handling
- Used on symfony.com website (#1391). Replaces Guzzle `Client` for
  `HttpClientInterface`
- Object is stateless, Guzzle is not. Doesn't handle cookies, cookies are state
- Remove boilerplate - use `toArray()`
- Options as third argument - array of headers, similar to Guzzle

### What can we do with the Response?

- `getStatusCode(): int`
- `getHeaders(): array`
- `getContent(): string`
- `toArray(): array`
- `cancel(): void`
- `getInfo(): array` - metadata
- Everything is lazy!
- 80% of use-cases covered

### What about PSR-18?

- Decorator/adapter to change to PSR compatible
- Same for Httplug

### What about the remaining 20%?

- Options are part of the abstraction, not the implementation

#### Some of the options

- `timeout` - control inactivity periods
- `proxy` - get through a http proxy
- `on_progress` - display a progress bar / build a scoped client
- `base_url` - resolve relative URLS / build a scoped client
- `resolve` - protect webhooks against calls to internal endpoints
- `max_redirects` - disable or limit redirects

- Robust and failsafe by default

- Streamable uploads - `$mimeParts->toIterable()`.
- donwload a file

  ```php
  foreach ($client->stream($response) as $chunk) {
      // ...
  }
  ```

* Responses are lazy, requests are concurrent
* Asychronus requests. Reading in network order

```
foreach ($client->stream($responses) as $response => $chunk) {
    if ($chunk->isLast()) {
        // a $response completed
    } else {
        // a $response's got network activity or timeout
    }
}
```

- 379 request completed in 0.4s!
- `Stream` has second argument, max number of seconds to wait before yielding a
  timeout chunk
- `ResponseInterface::getInfo()` - get response headers, redirect count and URL,
  start time, HTTP method and code, user data and URL
  - `getInfo('debug')` - displays debug information

### The components

- `NativeHttpClient` and `CurlHttpClient`
  - both provide
    - 100% contracts
    - secure directs
    - extended (time) info
    - transparent HTTP compression and (de)chunking
    - automatic HTTP proxy configuration via env vars

#### `NativeHttpClient`

- is most portable, works for everyone
- based on HTTP stream wrapper with fixed redirect logic
- blocking until response headers arrive

#### `CurlHttpClient`

- Requires ext-curl with fixed redirection logic
- Multiplexing response headers and bodies
- Leverages HTTP/2 and PUSH when available
- Keeps connections open also between synchronous requests, no DNS resolution so
  things are faster

#### Decorators

- ScopingHttpClient - auto-configure options based on request URL
- MockHttpClient - for testing, doesn't make actual HTTP requests
- CachingHttpClient - adds caching on a HTTP request
- Psr18Client
- HttplugClient
- TraceableHttpClient

### Combining

#### FrameworkBundle/Autowiring

```yml
framework:
  http_client:
    max_host_connections: 4
    deault_options:
      # ....
  scoped_client:
    # ...
```

#### HttpBrowser

- HttpClient + DomCrawler + CssSelector + HttpKernel + BrowserKit
- RIP Goutte!

### Coming in 4.4...

- `max_duration`
- `buffer` based on a callable
- `$chunk->isInformational()`
- `$response->toStream()`
- Async-compatible extensibility, when decoration is not enough

`composer req symfony/http-client`

## Symfony Checker is coming (Valentine Boineau)

- Static analysis tool for Symfony
  - Does a method exist?
  - Is it deprecated?
- insight.symfony.com
- @symfonyinsight
- Released soon

### Differences

- Specialise in Symfony - can see more relevant things
- Different interface to other services

## Feeling unfulfilled by SPA promises? Go back to Twig (Dan Blows)

A way on the front-end JS, CSS, images at the beginning of the request, sends a
HTTP request (XHR/AJAX) to the back-end

### Why SPAs?

- A way on the front-end JS, CSS, images at the beginning of the request, sends
  a HTTP request (XHR/AJAX) to the back-end
- no full page refresh
- Supposed to be much quicker
- 'Right tool for the job' - JS on the front-end, PHP on the back-end
- Division of responsibility == faster development
- Reusable API - Api -> Mobile App and SPA - easy to add another consumer
- Easier to debug?

### Why not SPAs?

- Lots of HTTP requests (400 to load the initial page on one project) == slow
  front end
- Blurred responsibilities == tightly coupled teams
- harder to debug, bugs fall between systems and teams. Huge gap between
  front-end and back-end, passing responsibilites.
- You can fix these problems in SPAs, but is it worth it?
  - Examples of good SPAs - Trello, Flickr

### Using Twig as an alternative to an SPA?

#### Faster UI - Try and figure out where the problem is.

If you're trying to speed things up, find out where the problem is.

- Browser tools
- Web Debug Toolbar
- Blackfire
- Optimise and monitor

#### Speed up Twig

- Speeding up Symfony
- ext/twig (PHP5 only, not PHP 7)
- Store compiled templates in Opcache, make sure it's enabled
- Render assets though the webserver (assetic not running all the time)

#### Edge side includes

- Component cached differently to the rest of the page
- Varnish/Nginx
- `render_esi`
- News block that caches frequently, rest of the page

#### HTTP/2 with Weblink

- slow finding CSS files to load - 'push' over CSS files, doesn't need to wait
- `preload()` - https://symfony.com/doc/current/web_link.html

#### Live updating pages

- Instantly update when sports results are updated, news articles are added
- Mercure - https://github.com/symfony/mercure
- LiveTwig - whole block or whole section, and live update `render_live`
- Turbolinks - replace whole body, keeps CSS and JS in memory. Merges new stuff
  in. `helthe/turbolinks`
- ReactPHP - shares kernel between requests

### Writing better code with Twig

- Keep templates simple. Avoid spaghetti code, only about UI. HTML or small
  amounts of Twig.
- Avoid delimeter chains
  - Bad:`blog_post.authors.first.user_account.email_address`
  - Good `{{ blog_post.authors_email_address }}`
  - Less brittle, slow

* Filters
  - Use filters to be precise
  - Custom filters
  - Avoid chains. Can cause odd results. Create a new filter in PHP
* Functions
  - Write your own functions
  - Simpler templates
  - Get data, can use boolean statements
* Components
  - Break a page into components rather than one large page
  - `include()`
  - Use `only` to only pass that data. less tightenly coupled.
  * `render` calls the whole of Symfony, boots Kernel, can be expensive and slow
  * Loosely couple templates and controllers
    - Keep responses simple
    - What makes sense
    - if you need extra data in the template, get it in the template
  * View models
    - Mixed results
    - `BlogPostViewModel`
    - Can result in boilerplate code
    - Can be useful if the view model is different to the Entity
  * DRY
    - "Don't repeat yourself"

- Faster development
  - Separate UI tests from back-end tests. Different layers for different teams.
    People don't need to run everything if they are only changing certain
    things.

* Help your front end
  - Webpack - Encore
  - Type hinting in functions and filters, easier to debug
  - Logging
  - Friendly exceptions - help front-end devs by returning meaningful, readbale
    errors
  - Web Debug Toolbar and Profiler, provide training for toolbar and profilers
  - Twig-friendly development environment - Twig support in IDEs and text
    editors

SPAs are sometimes teh right solution. Why do they want to use it, can the same
benefits be added with Twig?

3 most important points:

- Profile, identidy, optimise, monitor
- Loosely couple templates to your app code
- Help your front ends - put your front end developers first
- You don't need to use a SPA for single pages, use JavaScript for that one
  page. It doesn't need to be all or nothing.

## BDD Your Symfony Application (Kamil Kokot)

- Applying BDD to Sylius
- 2 years since release of Sylius (Symfony 2 alpha)
- The business part is more important than the code part

### What is BDD?

- Behaviour driven development. Combines TDD and DDD, into an agile methodology
- Encourages communication and creates shared understanding
- Living, executable documentation that non-programmers understand. Always
  correct.
- Feature file
  - Feature
  - Scenario - example of the behaviour for this feature. Simple, atomic. (e.g.
    I need a product in order to add it to a cart)
  - In order to...
  - Who gets the benefit?

### BDD in practice

- Feature: booking flight tickets
- Scenario: booking flight ticket for one person
  - Given there are the following flights...
  - When I visit '/flight/LTN-WAW'
  - Then I should be on '/flight/LTN-WAW'
  - Add I should see "Your flight has been booked." in "#result"
- In the BDD way - what is the business logic? What is the value for this
  scenario? What is the reason 'why', and who benefits from this?
  - We just need to know that there are 5 seats left on a flight
  - Talk and communicate about how the feature is going to work - not just
    developers
  - BDD aids communication
- Questions we can ask
  - Can we get a different outcome when the context changes?
    - When there was only one seat available
    - When there were no available seats
  - Can we get the same outcome when the event changes? Can we change 'When' and
    'Then stays the same'
    - When it is booked for an adult and a child
    - When it is booked for an adult
  - Does anything else happen that is not mentioned?
    - Generate an invoice if a seat is booked
    - a pilot would like to get a notification that a seat was booked.
  * Figuring out the rules
    - Adults are 15+ years old
    - Children are 2-14 years old
    - Infants and children can only travel with an adult
    - We don't allow for overbooking
  - Translating rules into examples
    - Add a new scenario for each rule - e.g. don't allow over booking
      - "And the flight should be no longer available..."

### Behat

- Used to automate and execute BDD tests, also SpecDDD
- maps steps to PHP code
- Given a context, when an event, then an outcome
- Domain Context, API context
- class implements `Context`, annotations for `@Given`, `@When`, `@Then`. allows
  for arguments and regular expressions
- Suites: change what code is executed, and what scenarios are executed. context
  and tags
- FriendsOfBehat SymfonyExtension - integrates Behat with Symfony
  - Contexts registered as Symfony services - inject dependencies, service as a
    context in Behat. Need to be 'public' for it to work
  - Reduces boilerplate code. Supports autowiring.
  - Zero configuration

### Domain context

- `Given` verb matches `@Given` annotation. Same for `When` and `Then`.
- Transformers, type hint name string, return Client instance

### API context

- inject `FlightBookingService` and `KernelBrowser`
- Use `$this->kernelBrowser->request()`
- Use `assert()` function wuthin `@Then`

### Back to reality - how it's done with Sylius

- Business part applies to all context. Start talking about what needs to be
  done, start communicating
- Implement contexts for UI and API
- 12716 steps, 1175 scenarios, 8 min 8 sec, 2.4 scenarios /sec
- 12x faster than JS (17 min 48 sec, 0.19 scenario / sec)
- Treat test CI environment like production

  - Turn off debug settings, add caching
  - Enable OPcache

- Write features in a natural way
- Too many setup steps - merge steps. less visual debt. e.g. Create currency,
  zone and locale when creating a store
- Avoid scenarios that are too detailed. You should specify only what's
  important to this scenario.

## Migrating to Symfony one route at a time (Steve Winter)

- New client with an old application, built in an old version of another
  framework with unusual dependency management, no tests, no version control and
  deploying via FTP. Done over a ~3 month period.

- Subscription based index of suppliers
- New requirements to implement by the client
- Our requirements: Needed a deployment process, make it testable, fix the build
  chain
- Solution attempt 1: Migrate to a new version of the current framework
  - Minor template and design changes were fine
  - Modifiy features, add new dependencies.
- Solution attempt 2: Upgrade to the latest version - same outcome due to
  multiple BC breaks (no semver), lots of manual steps
- Solution attempt 3: Symfony!
  - Semver! Backwards compatibility promise
  - Symfony app to run in parallel, Apache proxy rules and minor changes to the
    legacy app, added data transfer mechanisms
  - Anything new done in Symfony
  - Installed on the same server with it's own vhost but not publicly accessible
  - Deployed independently of legacy app

### Apache proxy rules

Proxy `/public` to symfony app

### Legacy app

- Shared cookie for single login between apps - user account details (name etc),
  session details (login time)

### Added functionality

- Built in Symfony
- new proxy rules for new routes
- Add menu links to legacy app menu
- How do we show how many reminders are active?
  - Symfony based API called from the front-end

### Migrating routes

- Rebuilt or extend in Symfony app
- Test and deploy, then update the apache config to add new proxy rules

### A gotcha

- Legacy app uses CSRF
- Needed to track the token, added to shared cookie and pass through to the
  Symfony side

### Storing data

- Both apps using the same data with different credentials
- Some shared tables, some tables are specific to each app

### Remaining challenges

- User session management, still handled by legacy app
- Templating/CSS - two versions of everything
  - Next step: move all CSS to Symfony

### Summary

- Add Symfony app, Apache proxy rules for routes
- User transfer mechanisms
- New functionality added in Symfony

### Is this right for you?

It depends. Fine for a 'modest' size. Use a real proxy for larger scale apps,
use different servers with database replication.

## Closing Keynote: The fabulous World of Emojis and other Unicode symbols (Nicolas Grekas)

- ASCII. Still used today. Map between the first 128 numbers to characters. OK
  for UK and US.
- 256 numbers in Windows-1252 (character sets). Each country had their own set.
- It's legacy. 0.2% for Windows-1252. 88.8% for UTF-8 (Feb 2017)
- Unicode: 130k characters, 135 scripts (alphabets)
- Validation errors using native alphabet - e.g. invalid last name when
  submitting a form
- 17 plans, each square is 255 code points
- Emojis are characters, not images
- Gliph is a visual representation of a character
- From code points to bytes
  - UTF-8: 1,2,3 or 4 bytes
  - UTF16: 2 or 4 bytes
  - UTF-32: 4 bytes
- UTF-8 is compatible with ASCII
- Case sensitivity - 1k characters are concerned. One uppercase letter, two
  lower case variants. Turkish exception (similar looking letters that are
  different letters with different meanings). Full case folding.
- Collations - ordering is depends on the language. 'ch' in Spanish is a single
  character.
- Single number in unicode to represent accents. Combining characters.
- Composed (NFC) and decomposed (NFD) forms - normalisation for comparison
- Grapheme clusters - multiple characters, but one letter as you write it
  (separate characters for letters and accent)
- Emjois - combining characters. e.g. Combine face with colour. Different codes
  and character names. Also applies to ligatures. A way to combine several
  images together into one single visual representation.

### unicode fundamentals

- uppercase, lowercase, folding
- compositions, ligatures
- comparistions - normalisations and collations
- segmentation: characters, words, sentences and hyphens
- locales: cultural conventions, translitterations
- identifiers & security, confusables
- display: direction, width

### unicode in practice

- MySQL - `utf*_*`. `SET NAMES utf8mb4` for security and storing emojis. Cannot
  store emojis with `utf8`

### in php

- `mb_*()`
- `iconv_*()`
- `preg_*()`
- `grapheme_*()` `normalizer_*()`
- `symfony/polyfill-*` - pure PHP implementation
- Made a component - **symfony/string** -
  https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/33553
- Object orientated api for strings. Immutable value objects
- `AbstractString`
  - `GraphemeString`
  - `Utf8String`
  - `BinaryString`

* AbstractString - Methods to serialize, get length, to binary or grapheme or
  utf8
  - Methods for starts with, ends with, is empty, join, prepend, split, trim,
    title etc
