Aside from the obvious candidates such as Views, CCK etc, here are a list of 10
contributed modules that I currently use on each Drupal project.

So, in no particular order:

- **[Admin](http://drupal.org/project/admin):** <br>The admin module provides UI
  improvements to the standard Drupal admin interface. I've just upgraded to the
  new [6.x-2.0-beta4](http://drupal.org/node/835870) version, and installed the
  newly-required
  [Rubik](http://code.developmentseed.org/rubik)/[Tao](http://code.developmentseed.org/tao)
  themes. So far, so good!
- **[Better Permissions](http://drupal.org/project/better_perms)/[Filter Permissions](http://drupal.org/project/filter_perms):
  <br>**Basic permissions is a basic module which enhances the Drupal
  Permissions page to support collapsing and expanding permission rows. Filter
  permissions provides filters at the top of the Permissions page for easier
  management when your site has a large amount of roles and/or permissions.
- **[Better Formats](http://drupal.org/project/better_formats): <br>**Better
  formats is a module to add more flexibility to Drupal's core input format
  system.
- **[Clone module](http://drupal.org/project/node_clone):**<br>Allows users to
  make a copy of an existing item of site content (a node) and then edit that
  copy.
- **[Vertical Tabs](http://drupal.org/project/vertical_tabs):<br>**Integrated
  into Drupal 7 core, this module adds vertical tabs to the node add and edit
  forms.
- **[Context](http://drupal.org/project/context):<br>**Context allows you to
  manage contextual conditions and reactions for different portions of your
  site. You can think of each context as representing a "section" of your site.
  For each context, you can choose the conditions that trigger this context to
  be active and choose different aspects of Drupal that should react to this
  active context.
- **[Node Picker](http://drupal.org/project/nodepicker):**<br>A rewrite of the
  module [TinyMCE Node Picker](http://drupal.org/project/tinymce_node_picker).
  Allows you to easily create links to internal nodes.
- **[Module Filter](http://drupal.org/project/module_filter):**<br>What this
  module aims to accomplish is the ability to quickly find the module you are
  looking for without having to rely on the browsers search feature which more
  times than not shows you the module name in the 'Required by' or 'Depends on'
  sections of the various modules or even some other location on the page like a
  menu item.
- **[Zenophile](http://drupal.org/project/zenophile):**<br>Quickly create Zen
  subthemes.
- **[Add Another](http://drupal.org/project/addanother):**<br>Add another
  displays a message after a user creates a node, and/or displays an "Add
  another" tab on nodes allowing them to make another node of the same type. You
  can control what roles and node types see this feature.
