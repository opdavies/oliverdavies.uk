Yesterday evening I went along and spoke at the
[UnifiedDiff meetup](http://www.unifieddiff.co.uk) in Cardiff, having offered
previously to do a presentation providing an introduction to Drupal.

I'm an experienced Drupal Developer, but not an experienced public speaker
(although I have done several user training sessions and Drupal demonstrations
for clients previously), and I think that some of the nerves that I had
beforehand were apparent during the presentation, and being the first speaker
for the evening probably didn't help, although I did get a
[nice tweet](https://twitter.com/craigmarvelley/status/243418608720543745)
mid-way through.

Initially, after aiming for a 20-minute presentation plus Q&A, I think I wrapped
up the presentation in around 14 minutes, although I did about 6 minutes of
answering questions afterwards including the apparently mandatory "Why use
Drupal compared to WordPress or Joomla?" question, some Drupal 8 and Symfony
questions, as well as an interesting question about the White House development
project after I'd listed it within a list of example sites. Next time, I think
that some more detailed presenter notes are needed. Typically, as soon as it sat
back in my seat, the majority of things that I'd managed to remember beforehand
all came flooding back to me and I thought "I should have said that whilst I was
up speaking".

Overall, considering my inexperience at speaking to this type of audience, I was
fairly happy with my presentation, although I'm sure that I'll change my mind
once I've watched the video of it on the UnifiedDiff website. Regardless, I
think that it was a great experience and I enjoyed doing it, and I'd like to
thank the organisers of UnifiedDiff for having me speak at their meetup. It was
great to have a more relaxed conversation with some people after the other
speakers had been up, and having introduced Drupal I would be more than happy to
come back and do a more in-depth presentation if there is an interest for me to
do so.
