My first blog post was published on the Inviqa website last week. Is an introduction to automated testing in Drupal, which also includes a recap of the workshop that I recently gave at DrupalCamp London.

The blog post can be found at <https://inviqa.com/blog/drupal-automated-testing-introduction>, and there's more information about the workshop specifically at <https://github.com/opdavies/workshop-drupal-automated-testing>.
