As a heavily-reliant
[Quicksilver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_%28software%29) user on
my MacBook Pro, I was glad when I found the
[Teleport](http://drupal.org/project/teleport) module for
[Drupal](http://drupal.org) _(due to Elliott Rothman's
[tweet](http://twitter.com/elliotttt/status/18044234238))_.

When you press a configurable hot-key, a jQuery dialog box appears where you can
search for nodes by title or path, or directly enter the path that you want to
navigate to. This will greatly reduce the number of clicks that I need to
perform to get to my desired page - even compared to the
[Admin](http://drupal.org/project/admin) and
[Administration Menu](http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu) modules.

Although it's not a new module (the first commits were 2 years ago), I hope that
they are still planning on achieving the list of future directions listed on
their Drupal.org project page:

- Make interface act more like Quicksilver (i.e. you should only have to press
  Enter once to launch)
- 'Actions' like Quicksilver: if you select a node, a second input should appear
  with options to go to the View page, Edit page, (un)publish, etc. Same with
  users.
- Hook into more non-node content, like taxonomy terms and functions in the API
  module.

Personally, this will make navigation around both the front-end and
administration area of my Drupal sites so much easier.
