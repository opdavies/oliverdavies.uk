Earlier this year, I posted a solution to
[an issue](http://drupal.org/node/753898) on the Drupal.org issue queue.
Originally, I just posted the code back onto the issue, but have now created a
patch that can easily be applied to any Drupal 6 installation. Here is a
run-through of the process of creating and applying a patch. In this case, I
made changes to the `user_pass_validate()` function that's found within
`modules/user/user.pages.inc`.

To begin with, a download a fresh copy of Drupal 6.19 and created a copy of the
original user.pages.inc file. Within the duplicate file, I made the same changes
to the function that I did in earlier code, and saved the changes. Now, within
my Terminal, I can navigate to Drupal's root directory and create the patch.

```language-bash
diff -rup modules/user/user.pages.inc modules/user/user.pages2.inc > /Users/oliver/Desktop/different_messages_for_blocked_users.patch
```

This command compares the differences between the two files, and creates the
specified patch file.

To apply the patch to my Drupal installation, I go back to Terminal and run the
following code:

```language-bash
patch -p0 < /Users/oliver/Desktop/different_messages_for_blocked_users.patch
```

If, for some reason, I need to reverse the patch, I can run this code:

```language-bash
patch -p0 -R < /Users/oliver/Desktop/different_messages_for_blocked_users.patch
```

And that's it!

There is also a Git patch creation workflow, which is described at
<http://groups.drupal.org/node/91424>. Thanks to
[Randy Fay](http://randyfay.com) for making me aware of this, and suggesting a
slight change to my original patch creation command.
