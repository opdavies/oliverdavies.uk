Following a recent conversation on Twitter with
[socketwench](https://twitter.com/socketwench) about project switching in
PhpStorm, I thought I’d document my workflow here.

Here is the original tweet and my initial response. I also have a lot of
PhpStorm projects, and as I’m always working on multiple projects I regularly
need to switch between them.

{% include 'tweet' with {
    content: '<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think you can start typing and it will filter?</p>&mdash; Oliver Davies (@opdavies) <a href="https://twitter.com/opdavies/status/1034472920532365312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2018</a>',
} %}

On the PhpStorm welcome screen that displays when you first open it, your recent
projects are displayed on the left-hand side of the screen, and are filterable.
That means that I can start typing a project name, e.g. `oli`, and I will only
see projects that start with that input.

That’s great when opening a project from scratch, but what about when we’re
already within a project and just want to be able to switch to another?

{% include 'tweet' with {
    content: '<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can also use &#39;Open recent&#39; within the actions list, and then filter the list of projects. <a href="https://t.co/k8G9iIQNP0">pic.twitter.com/k8G9iIQNP0</a></p>&mdash; Oliver Davies (@opdavies) <a href="https://twitter.com/opdavies/status/1034542753651281920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2018</a>',
} %}

There’s also a way to access this list once PhpStorm is open, by clicking 'Open
Recent' within the File menu. The issue here though is that this list is not
filterable.

You can also access this list using the keyboard, though the 'Search everywhere'
or 'Find action' panes, and these are filterable.

Once the 'Open Recent' option is selected, you see the same project list as on
the welcome screen, which is filtered in the same way by starting to type
potential project names.

## Adding a Keyboard Shortcut

We can make this easier by adding a new keyboard shortcut. Within the Keymap
preferences, you can search for 'Open Recent' and right-click it to add a new
keyboard shortcut and define the key combination.

This this shortcut added, you can now use it to instantly bring up your recent
projects list, filter it and switch project.
