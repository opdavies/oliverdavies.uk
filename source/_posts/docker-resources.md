I've been speaking with a few people recently about Docker. Here are some resources that I found useful when I was learning Docker:

- [The Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com)
- [Shipping Docker video course by Chris Fidao](https://serversforhackers.com/shipping-docker)
- [Docker for PHP Developers eBook and video course by Paul Redmond](https://leanpub.com/docker-for-php-developers)
- [Docker for Developers eBook by Chris Tankersley](https://leanpub.com/dockerfordevs)
- [Docker YouTube video playlist that I've curated](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHn41Ay7w7kdt1thq6N6hpVABb2YNI50b)
- [AltF4Stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/thealtf4stream)
- [The "Full Stack Live" stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/fullstacklive)
- ["Docker Mastery" course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery)

I'm sure that I'll remember some others after I publish this post, but I'll come back and add them here afterward.

Know of any more? Let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/opdavies).
