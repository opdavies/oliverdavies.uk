After a busy few days, I've released two new contrib Drupal modules.

- [Block Aria Landmark Roles](http://drupal.org/project/block_aria_landmark_roles) -
  Inspired by [Block Class](http://drupal.org/project/block_class), this module
  adds additional elements to the block configuration forms that allow users to
  assign a ARIA landmark role to a block.
- [Nomensa Accessible Media Player](http://drupal.org/project/nomensa_amp) -
  Provides integration with Nomensa's
  [Accessible Media Player](https://github.com/nomensa/Accessible-Media-Player).

Documentation for both to follow shortly on Drupal.org.
