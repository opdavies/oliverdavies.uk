This weekend is [DrupalCamp London 2018][1]. I’ll be there along with a number
of my [Microserve][2] colleagues.

I look forward to DrupalCamp London every year, partly because it was the first
DrupalCamp that I attended back in 2014. It was also the first DrupalCamp that I
[gave a talk][3] at, when I presented a session about Git Flow having given only
one user group talk before.

I’ve presented sessions at every DrupalCamp London since (including two last
year), and I’m lucky enough to be [speaking again this year][4] due to one of
the originally announced speakers no longer being able to make it to the event.

Here are some other sessions that I’m hoping to see (in no particular order):

- Keynote by [Ryan Szrama][5] from [Commerce Guys][6]
- [Drupal 8 Services And Dependency Injection](https://drupalcamp.london/session/drupal-8-services-and-dependency-injection)
  by Phil Norton
- [Growing developers with Drupal](https://drupalcamp.london/session/growing-developers-drupal)
  by Fran Garcia-Linares (fjgarlin)
- [How to make it easier for newcomers to get involved in Drupal](https://drupalcamp.london/session/how-make-it-easier-newcomers-get-involved-drupal)
  by heather
- [Let’s take the best route - Exploring Drupal 8 Routing System](https://drupalcamp.london/session/lets-take-best-route-exploring-drupal-8-routing-system)
  by surbhi
- [New recipe of Decoupling: Drupal 8, Symfony and Slim Framework](https://drupalcamp.london/session/new-recipe-decoupling-drupal-8-symfony-and-slim-framework)
  by Jyoti Singh
- [Plugin API by examples](https://drupalcamp.london/session/plugin-api-examples)
  by Gabriele (gambry)
- [Value of mentorship in the community](https://drupalcamp.london/session/value-mentorship-community)
  by Hussain Abbas (hussainweb)
- [Warden - Helping Drupal Agencies Sleep at Night](https://drupalcamp.london/session/warden-helping-drupal-agencies-sleep-night)
  by Mike Davis

Unfortunately there are some time slots where I’d like to see more than one of
the talks (including when I’m going to be speaking). This regularly happens at
conferences, but I’ll look forward to watching those on [YouTube][7] after the
event.

I’m also looking forward to catching up with former colleagues, spending some
time in the "hallway track" and hopefully doing some sprinting too!

## Finally

For nostalgia, [here’s the blog post][0] that I wrote before I attended my first
DrupalCamp London.

See everyone this weekend!
