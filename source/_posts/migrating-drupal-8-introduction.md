I recently finished porting this website from a static site generator to Drupal 8, meaning that this site has now been powered by three different major versions of Drupal (6, 7 and 8) as well as by two static site generators since it was first launched in early 2010.

The majority of the content was imported using migrations from JSON feeds that I created. This included:

- Blog tags
- Blog posts
- Talks
- Redirects

In some follow-up posts, I'll be looking at each migration separately, describing any issues and look at how it was used to import its respective content.

I'll update this post with the links to the follow-up posts, and they are also available from the [blog series' page](/taxonomy/term/165).
