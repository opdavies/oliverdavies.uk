As the vast majority of the Drupal websites that I currently work on are built
on Drupal 7, I thought that it was time that I upgraded this site. Following the
[core upgrade process](http://drupal.org/node/570162) and the
[CCK migration process](http://drupal.org/node/1144136), everything was upgraded
smoothly without any issues.

I've upgraded a handful of essential contrib modules to the latest stable
version, [Administration Menu](http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu),
[Views](http://drupal.org/project/views) etc., and will continue upgrading the
other modules on the site as time allows.

I also prefer [Bartik](http://drupal.org/project/bartik) to
[Garland](http://drupal.org/project/garland) - but I will be creating a new
custom theme when I get a chance.
