If you use the [Zen](http://drupal.org/project/zen) theme, then you should also
be using the [Zenophile](http://drupal.org/project/zenophile) module!

The Zenophile module allows you to very quickly create Zen subthemes from within
your web browser, as well as editing options such as the site directory where it
should be placed, the layout type (fixed or fluid), page wrapper and sidebar
widths, and the placement of the sidebars.
