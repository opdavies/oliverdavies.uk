I used to maintain a number of [Ansible roles][roles], and I recently wrote one
for automatically generating `settings.php` files for Drupal projects that I use
for some client projects as part of the [Ansible and Ansistrano deployment
process][talk], as it can populate these files with credentials stored in
Ansible Vault.

I uploaded an initial version of the role [onto GitHub][github], but haven’t yet
released it onto Ansible Galaxy.

I’d seen in other people’s roles and read elsewhere about writing automated
tests for Ansible roles using a tool called [Molecule][molecule], and wanted to
write some tests for this role before publishing it onto Galaxy.

I looked around for resources about Molecule, and found a [blog post by Jeff
Geerling][jeff-post], but also this YouTube video that I found very helpful.

I’ve since been re-writing the role from scratch based on Molecule, and plan to
release an official version of it soon.
