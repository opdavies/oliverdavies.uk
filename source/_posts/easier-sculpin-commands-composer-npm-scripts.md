In this video, I show you how I've simplied my Sculpin and Gulp workflow using
custom Composer and NPM scripts.

My website includes several various command line tools - e.g. [Sculpin][4],
[Gulp][5] and [Behat][6] - each needing different arguments and options,
depending on the command being run. For example, for Sculpin, I normally include
several additional options when viewing the site locally - the full command that
I use is
`./vendor/bin/sculpin generate --watch --server --clean --no-interaction`.
Typing this repeatedly is time consuming and could be easily mis-typed,
forgotten or confused with other commands.

In this video, I show you how I've simplied my Sculpin and Gulp workflow using
custom Composer and NPM scripts.

## Scripts

Here are the scripts that Iâ€™m using - they are slightly different from those in
the video. I use the `--generate` and `--watch` options for Sculpin and the
`gulp watch` command for NPM. I had to change these before the recording as I
was using the [demo magic][0] script to run the commands, and existing from a
watch session was also ending the script process.

### composer.json

```language-json
"scripts": {
    "clean": "rm -rf output_*/",
    "dev": "sculpin generate --clean --no-interaction --server --watch",
    "production": "sculpin generate --clean --no-interaction --env='prod' --quiet"
}
```

Run with `composer run <name>`, e.g. `composer run dev`.

### package.json

```language-json
"scripts": {
    "init": "yarn && bower install",
    "dev": "gulp watch",
    "production": "gulp --production"
}
```

Run with `npm run <name>`, e.g. `npm run production`.

You can also take a look at the full [composer.json][1] and [package.json][2]
files within my site repository on [GitHub][3].
