How to use [Drush](https://drupal.org/project/drush) to quickly build a new
sub-theme of [Zen](https://drupal.org/project/zen).

First, download the [Zen](https://drupal.org/project/zen 'The Zen theme') theme
if you haven't already done so.

```language-bash
$ drush dl zen
```

This will now enable you to use the "drush zen" command.

```language-bash
$ drush zen "Oliver Davies" oliverdavies --description="A Zen sub-theme for oliverdavies.co.uk" --without-rtl
```

The parameters that I'm passing it are:

1. The human-readable name of the theme.
2. The machine-readable name of the theme.
3. The description of the theme (optional).
4. A flag telling Drush not to include any right-to-left elements within my
   sub-theme as these aren't needed (optional).

This will create a new theme in sites/all/themes/oliverdavies.

For further help, type `$ drush help zen` to see the Drush help page for the zen
command.
