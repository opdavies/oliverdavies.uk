After reading numerous blog posts about how to install
[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2 'Sublime Text 2') in
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/2 'Ubuntu'), this is definitely the quickest way!

Just paste the following lines into your Terminal:

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-2
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install sublime-text
```

After running this, Sublime Text 2 has been installed within the
_/usr/lib/sublime-text-2_ directory and can be launched from the Dashboard, or
by typing `subl`, `sublime-text` or `sublime-text-2` into a Terminal window.
