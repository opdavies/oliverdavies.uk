How to use the .htaccess file to forward to a different domain.

Within the mod_rewrite section of your .htaccess file, add the following lines:

```language-apacheconf
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^yoursite\.co\.uk$
RewriteRule (.*) http://yoursite.com/$1 [R=301,L]
```

This automatically forwards any users from http://yoursite.co.uk to
http://yoursite.com. This can also be used to forward multiple domains:

```language-apacheconf
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^yoursite\.co\.uk$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^yoursite\.info$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^yoursite\.biz$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^yoursite\.eu$
RewriteRule (.*) http://yoursite.com/$1 [R=301,L]
```

If any of the RewriteCond conditions apply, then the RewriteRule is executed.
