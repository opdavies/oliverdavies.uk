Today, I realised that I hadn't published the code that I used to create the
total figures of galleries and photos at the top of the gallery (I said at the
end of
[Part 2](/blog/create-better-photo-gallery-drupal-part-2/ 'Create a Better Photo Gallery in Drupal - Part 2')
that I'd include it in
[Part 3](/blog/create-better-photo-gallery-drupal-part-3/ 'Create a Better Photo Gallery in Drupal - Part 3'),
but I forgot). So, here it is:

```language-php
<?php

// Queries the database and returns a list of nids of published galleries.
$galleries = db_query("SELECT nid FROM {node} WHERE type = 'gallery' AND status = 1");
// Resets the number of photos.
$output = 0;
// Prints a list of nids of published galleries.
while($gallery = db_fetch_array($galleries)) {
  $gallery_id = $gallery['nid'];
  $photos = $photos + db_result(db_query("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM node n, content_type_photo ctp WHERE n.status = 1 AND n.type = 'photo' AND ctp.field_gallery_nid = $gallery_id AND n.nid = ctp.nid"));
}

// Prints the output.
print 'There ';
if($photos == 1) {
  print 'is';
}
else {
  print 'are';
}
print ' currently ';
print $photos . ' ';
if($photos == 1) {
  print 'photo';
}
else {
  print 'photos';
}
print ' in ';

// Counts the number of published galleries on the site.
$galleries = db_result(db_query("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {node} WHERE TYPE = 'gallery' AND STATUS = 1"));

// Prints the number of published galleries.
print $galleries;
if ($galleries == 1) {
  print ' gallery';
}
else {
  print ' galleries';
}
print '.';
?>
```

It was applied to the view as a header which had the input format set to PHP
code.
