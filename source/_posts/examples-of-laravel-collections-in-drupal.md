Since starting to work with Laravel as well as Drupal and Symfony, watching Adam
Wathan’s [Refactoring to Collections][0] course as well as [lessons on
Laracasts][6], I’ve become a fan of [Laravel’s Illuminate Collections][1] and
the object-orientated pipeline approach for interacting with PHP arrays.

In fact I’ve given a talk on [using Collections outside Laravel][2] and have
written a [Collection class module][3] for Drupal 7.

I’ve also tweeted several examples of code that I’ve written within Drupal that
use Collections, and I thought it would be good to collate them all here for
reference.

Thanks again to [Tighten][4] for releasing and maintaining the
[tightenco/collect library][5] that makes it possible to pull in Collections via
Composer.
