I've been quite busy during COVID-19 and various lockdowns, giving talks remotely at conferences and user groups.

In mid-April, I send a tweet with an open offer to any user groups that needed a speaker, with some suggestions for talks that I'd given recently that I could present remotely.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Drupal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Drupal</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PHP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PHP</a> usergroups (and others):<br><br>I have three talks that I&#39;d be happy to do for any remote meetups:<br><br>- Deploying PHP applications with Ansible, Ansible Vault and Ansistrano<br>- Taking Flight with Tailwind CSS<br>- TDD - Test Driven Drupal<br><br>Ping me if you need a speaker...</p>&mdash; Oliver Davies (@opdavies) <a href="https://twitter.com/opdavies/status/1250870367712935938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

As well as this, I also applied to some open calls for papers for remote conferences, such as [CMS Philly](https://cmsphilly.org "The CMS Philly conference") (formerly Drupaldelphia) that was taking place online this year.

At the time of writing, these are the talks that I've given remotely or are already planned for future dates. I'll be updating this list going forward as new talks are added, as well as my [talks page](/talks "My upcoming and past talks").

If you'd like me to speak at your online conference or user group and be added to this list, please contact me and we can see if we can find a suitable date.
