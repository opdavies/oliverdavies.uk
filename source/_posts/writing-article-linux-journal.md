I'm absolutely delighted to announce that I'm going to be writing an article for
[Linux Journal](http://www.linuxjournal.com) magazine's upcoming Drupal special.

The article is going to be entitled "Speeding Up Your Drupal Development Using
Installation Profiles and Distributions" and will be mentioning existing
distributions available on Drupal.org, but mainly focussing on the steps needed
to create your own custom distribution. Needless to say, I'm quite excited about
it!

The article is expected to be published in October.
