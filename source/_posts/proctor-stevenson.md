2 weeks ago, I handed in my notice of resignation to
[Horse & Country TV](http://horseandcountry.tv)because I've been offered a new
role at [Proctor & Stevenson](http://proctors.co.uk) - a Marketing Design and
Communications agency in Bristol.

Proctors have an [extensive client list](http://www.proctors.co.uk/clients) -
including [BMW](http://www.proctors.co.uk/clients/bmw-financial-services),
[Panasonic](http://www.proctors.co.uk/clients/panasonic), the
[Open University](http://www.proctors.co.uk/clients/open-university) and
[VOSA](http://www.proctors.co.uk/clients/vosa), and it's going to be a fantastic
opportunity for me to continue expanding my skillset whilst gaining vital
experience.
