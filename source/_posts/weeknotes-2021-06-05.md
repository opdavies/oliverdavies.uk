After the Bank Holiday weekend, I started working this week as a Lead Developer at [Transport for Wales](https://trc.cymru). I really enjoyed working at Inviqa, but felt that moving again to an in-house team would offer some new types of challenges whilst also getting to lead and manage a team.

It's been an interesting first week, and I've met a lot of new colleagues whilst also going through the regular TfW induction processes and getting to know the current team.

I'm looking forward to helping build and lead the development team at TfW, and plan on publishing regular weeknotes on the work that we're doing at Transport for Wales and TfW Rail.
