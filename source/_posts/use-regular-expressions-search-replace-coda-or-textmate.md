As in
[the original post](/blog/add-taxonomy-term-multiple-nodes-using-sql/ 'Quickly adding a taxonomy term to multiple nodes using SQL'),
I'd generated a list of node ID values, and needed to add structure the SQL
update statment formatted in a certain way. However, I changed my inital query
slightly to out put the same nid value twice.

```language-sql
SELECT nid, nid FROM node WHERE TYPE = 'blog' ORDER BY nid ASC;
```

Then, I could select all of the returned rows, copy the values, and paste them
into Coda:

As before, I needed my SQL update statement to be in the following format:

```language-sql
INSERT INTO term_node VALUE (nid, vid, tid), (nid2, vid2, tid);
```

As I mentioned previously, the nid and vid values are the same for each node,
and the tid will remain constant. In this case, the tid value that I needed to
use was '63'.

So, using the 'Find and Replace' function within Coda, combined with
[regular expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (regex),
I can easily format the values as needed. To begin with, I need to ensure that
the RegEx search option is enabled, and that I'm using the correct escape
character.

The first thing that I wanted to do was add the seperating comma between the two
values. To do this, I perform a search for `\s*\t`. This searches for everything
that is whitespace AND is a tab value. I can then add the comma as the
replacement for each result.

All 31 lines have been changed.

Next, I can use `\n` to target the lines between the rows. I'll replace it with
the next comma, the number 63 (the tid value), the closing bracket, another
comma, re-add the line and add the opening bracket.

The only two lines that aren't changed are the first and last, as they don't
have any line breaks following them. I can complete these lines manually. Now
all I need to do is add the beginning of the SQL update statement, then copy and
paste it into Sequel Pro.
