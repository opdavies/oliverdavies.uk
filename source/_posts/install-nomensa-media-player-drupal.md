This week I released the first version of the Nomensa Accessible Media Player
module for Drupal 7. Here's some instructions of how to install and configure
it.

_The official documentation for this module is now located at
<https://www.drupal.org/node/2383447>. This post was accurate at the time of
writing, whereas the documentation page will be kept up to date with any future
changes._

## Initial configuration

### Download the Library

The library can be downloaded directly from GitHub, and should be placed within
you _sites/all/libraries/nomensa_amp_ directory.

```language-bash
drush dl libraries nomensa_amp
git clone https://github.com/nomensa/Accessible-Media-Player sites/all/libraries/nomensa_amp
cd sites/all/libraries/nomensa_amp
rm -rf Accessible-media-player_2.0_documentation.pdf example/ README.md
drush en -y nomensa_amp
```

### Configure the Module

Configure the module at <em>admin/config/media/nomensa-amp</em> and enable the
players that you want to use.

## Adding videos

Within your content add links to your videos. For example:

### YouTube

```language-html
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi31YMGmQC4">Checking colour contrast</a>
```

### Vimeo

```language-html
<a href="http://vimeo.com/33729937">Screen readers are strange, when you're a stranger by Leonie Watson</a>
```

## Adding captions

The best way that I can suggest to do this is to use a File field to upload your
captions file:

1. Add a File field to your content type;
1. On your page upload the captions file.
1. Right-click the uploaded file, copy the link location, and use this for the
   path to your captions file.

For example:

```language-html
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi31YMGmQC4">Checking colour contrast</a> <a class="captions" href="http://oliverdavies.co.uk/sites/default/files/checking-colour-contrast-captions.xml">Captions for Checking Colour Contrast</a>
```
