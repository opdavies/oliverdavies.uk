The
[Domain Access project](https://drupal.org/project/domain 'The Domain Access project on Drupal.org')
is a suite of modules that provide tools for running a group of affiliated sites
from one Drupal installation and a single shared database. The issue is that the
domains are stored within the database so these are copied across when the data
is migrated between environments, whereas the domains are obviously going to
change.

Rather than changing the domain settings within the Domain module itself, the
best solution I think is to use table prefixes and create a different domain
table per environment. With a live, staging and local domains, the tables would
be named as follows:

```language-bash
live_domain
local_domain
staging_domain
```

Within each site's settings.php file, define the prefix for the domain table
within the databases array so that each site is looking at the correct table for
its environment.

```language-php
$databases['default']['default'] = array(
  'driver' => 'mysql',
  'database' => 'foobar',
  'username' => 'foo',
  'password' => 'bar',
  'host' => 'localhost',
  'prefix' => array(
    'default' => '',
    'domain' => 'local_', // This will use the local_domain table.
    // Add any other prefixed tables here.
  ),
);
```

Within each environment-specific domain table, update the subdomain column to
contain the appropriate domain names.
