Replace the \$page_id value with your Page ID number (unless you want to show
the number of fans for this site).You can find your Page ID by logging into your
Facebook account, going to 'Adverts and Pages', clicking 'Edit page', and
looking at the URL.

For example, mine is
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/edit/?id=143394365692197&sk=basic>.

I've also wrapped the output in a number_format() function so that it properly
formatted with commas etc - like where I've used it within the
[Gold Event listing](http://www.horseandcountry.tv/events/paid) on the Horse &
Country TV website.

```language-php
$page_id = "143394365692197";
$xml = @simplexml_load_file("http://api.facebook.com/restserver.php?method=facebook.fql.query&amp;query=SELECT%20fan_count%20FROM%20page%20WHERE%20page_id=".$page_id."") or die ("a lot");
$fans = $xml->page->fan_count;
print number_format($fans);
```
