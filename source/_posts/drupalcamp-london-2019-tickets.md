{% include 'tweet' with {
    content: '<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The time is finally here. You can now purchase your tickets. Early Bird finishes on 2nd January 2019 - <a href="https://t.co/aG6jstmWzv">https://t.co/aG6jstmWzv</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Drupal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Drupal</a></p>&mdash; DrupalCamp London (@DrupalCampLDN) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrupalCampLDN/status/1064584179113971712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2018</a>

I’ve attended, given talks and volunteered previously, would definitely
recommend others doing so, and I plan on attending and submitting again myself
for 2019. If there’s something in particular that you’d like to see me give a
talk on, let me know - I’d be happy to hear any suggestions. Alternatively, if
you’d like to submit and would like some help writing an abstract or want some
feedback on a talk idea, please get in touch.

_Note: I am not an organiser of DrupalCamp London, nor am I involved with the
session selection process._

Hopefully there will be no [#uksnow][3] this year!

DrupalCamp London is the 1-3 March 2019. Early bird tickets are available until
2 January 2019, and the call for sessions is open until 21 January.
