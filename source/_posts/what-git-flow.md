Here are my slides from my "What is Git Flow?" session at
[DrupalCamp London](http://2014.drupalcamplondon.co.uk).

## Take aways

The main take aways are:

- Git Flow adds various commands into Git to enhance its native functionality,
  which creates a branching model to separate your stable production code from
  your unstable development code.
- Never commit directly to the master branch - this is for production code only!
- You can commit directly to the develop branch, but this should be done
  sparingly.
- Use feature branches as much as possible - one per feature, user story or bug.
- Commit early and often, and push to a remote often to encourage collaboration
  as well as to provide a backup of your code.
- You can use settings within services like GitHub and Bitbucket to only allow
  certain users to push to the master and develop branches, and restrict other
  Developers to only commit and push to feature branches. Changes can then be
  committed and pushed, then reviewed as part of a peer code review, and merged
  back into the develop branch.
