If you attended my automated testing and test driven development workshop this weekend at DrupalCamp NYC, or at DrupalCamp London in March, [here are the notes][notes] that we went through during the session.

There is also [a separate code repository][code] that contains the example code, broken down commit by commit, and uses GitHub Actions to run the tests automatically on each push.
