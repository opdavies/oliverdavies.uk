If you use the [Features module](http://drupal.org/project/features) to manage
your Drupal configuration, it can be time consuming to update features through
the UI, especially if you are working on a remote server and need to keep
downloading and uploading files.

If you re-create a feature through the UI, you'll be prompted to download a new
archive of the feature in its entirety onto your local computer. You could
either commit this into a local repository and then pull it remotely, or use a
tool such as SCP to upload the archive onto the server and commit it from there.
You can simplify this process by using [Drush](http://drush.org).

## Finding Components

To search for a component, use the `drush features-components` command. This
will display a list of all components on the site. As we're only interested in
components that haven't been exported yet, add the `--not-exported` option to
filter the results.

To filter further, you can also use the `grep` command to filter the results.
For example, `drush features-components --not-exported field_base | grep foo`,
would only return non-exported field bases containing the word "foo".

The result is a source and a component, separated by a colon. For example,
`field_base:field_foo`.

## Exporting the Feature

Once you have a list of the components that you need to add, you can export the
feature. This is done using the `drush features-export` command, along with the
feature name and the component names.

For example:

```language-bash
$ drush features-export -y myfeature field_base:field_foo field_instance:user-field_foo
```

In this example, the base for field_boo and it's instance on the user object is
being added to the "myfeature" feature.

If you are updating an existing feature, you'll get a message informing you that
the module already exists and asking if you want to continue. This is fine, and
is automatically accepted by including `-y` within the command. If a feature
with the specified name doesn't exist, it will be created.

If you're creating a new feature, you can define where the feature will be
created using the `--destination` option.

Once complete, you will see a confirmation message.

> Created module: my feature in sites/default/modules/custom/features/myfeature

## The Result

Once finished, the feature is updated in it's original location, so there's no
download of the feature and then needing to re-upload it. You can add and commit
your changes into Git or continue with your standard workflow straight away.
