[Build Configs](/build-configs) is a tool I've created for creating and managing customised per-project configuration files, such as Docker, Docker Compose, Nix Flakes, and PHPUnit and PHPStan configuration.

In this lightning talk, I'll discuss why I created it, what problem it solves, more about what it does, and how it works.
