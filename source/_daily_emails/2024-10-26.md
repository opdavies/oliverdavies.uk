  I'm thinking of new ideas for SaaS applications or products.
---

As well as my consulting and development work, and educational content such as my [automated testing email course][0], I'd like to release something as a project people can use or a SaaS product for people to purchase.

One of my original ideas was to build a website for speakers to upload and manage their presentations, but I found [Symposium][1].

I was building a hosted dashboard for multiple Drupal applications so people could see all their projects and available updates in one place, but someone made me aware of [Drupal Remote Dashboard][2]. Whilst it's not exactly the same, the idea is similar, so I'm thinking whether to continue with this.

I have a short list of other ideas, but if you have one, reply and let me know.
