I'm happy to be speaking again at [PHP South West][event] next week for my 98th talk or workshop and eighth at PHPSW.

This talk will be on [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io) - a static site generator written in PHP.

I first presented a Sculpin talk at [DrupalCamp North in July 2015][talk] while learning Twig before Drupal 8.

If you'd like a sneak peek of the demo site I'm building, [it's on GitHub][repo], and I posted a screenshot on [Twitter][tweet].
