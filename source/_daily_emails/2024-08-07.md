Which do you do more?

Read code or write code?

If you include colleagues' code, logs and CI pipeline output, open-source software, books, courses, tutorials, examples, videos, live streams, meetup and conference talks and blog posts (just to think of some), you definitely read more code than you write.

Which is why it's important to [optimise for readability][0].
