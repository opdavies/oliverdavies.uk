Yesterday, I posted a screenshot from my [automated testing in Drupal email course][atdc] on Twitter as a sneak peek of what's included.

Here it is again:

I also posted a screenshot of the accompanying code in my text editor, Neovim, which had a few likes.

Since July 2021, I've used Neovim as my daily driver for writing all my code, which I spoke about during my [Working without Workspace talk].

You can also see my NixOS-based [dotfiles on GitHub](https://github.com/opdavies/dotfiles) which contains my Neovim configuration.

Register now to find out when the email course is live, or [read the first lesson][first lesson].
