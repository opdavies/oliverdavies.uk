I've been a Mentor for students on a coding bootcamp a few times before, and I'm looking forward to doing this again - this time with [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk).

After hearing about them at a PHP meetup last year, I was keen to get involved after the previous bootcamp I was involved with closed its doors.

I've always been impressed to see people with little, or usually no prior coding experience, on these bootcamps and what they can learn and achieve in a short amount of time - and one of the things that drew me to School of Code is that the bootcamp is free for learners.

This week is the mentor kick-off session, with the new cohort starting next week.

I'm looking forward to seeing who I'm paired up with, and helping them take their first steps into a career in software development.
