  If you're giving a presentation or mob programming, avoid using custom aliases.

Shell aliases are a good way to increase productivity by shortening long commands, adding additional options to existing ones or creating new ones that even combine multiple commands.

Common aliases are `g` for `git`, `gs` for `git status` and `dr` for `drush`, but they will be different for each person depending on what tools they use and what commands they type often.

Whilst aliases are great for personal productivity, there are times I'd suggest not using them.

If you're giving a demo as part of a presentation or working in a pair or mob, either use the full commands or explain what custom aliases or functions you're running, what they do, and how they differ from the default functionality.

I recently watched a video where someone was using a `gc` command.

It could have been an alias for `git clone`, `git checkout`, `git commit` or `git cherry-pick` - just to name a few options.

It could have been something else altogether.

Another approach I use is to have aliases auto-expand and show the full command. This makes it possible for others to see the commands being executed and reminds you, too.
