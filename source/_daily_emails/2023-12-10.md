When writing code, it's common to suffix the class name with the type of class it is.

I do this often for most types of classes, such as Controllers, EventListeners, Factories, Repositories and Builders.

However, I don't always for value objects and data transfer objects (DTOs).

Also, I don't always suffix interfaces with `Interface`.

I've been re-reading the documentation for the Symfony Serializer component, which references both `NameConverterInterface` and `MyDto::class`.

Whilst it does make the names more verbose, it does clarify what the class is used for.

Symfony's coding standards and Drupal's PHP coding standards have conventions for this, but what do you think?

Do you add suffixes to your class or interface names, or do you prefer the simplified versions?
