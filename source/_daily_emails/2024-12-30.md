  Do you purchase domain names and manage hosting for clients? I don't and here's why.
---

I've worked for agencies who, as well as building or developing web applications, will purchase domain names and manage hosting for clients.

I've worked at agencies who insisted on hosting applications they built.

This is probably easier for clients initially, but things were harder on any project that needed transferring a domain name or migrating to a new hosting environment.

I do this for myself, but I don't get involved with domain names or hosting for clients.

I'm happy to give recommendations based on my experience using platform as a service (PaaS) offering and self hosting, but I want the client to set this up themselves.

That means it's their account and they can contact someone if there is an issue, but mainly because they're in control.

I want clients to work with me because they want to and not because they're locked in as I manage their domain name or hosting.
