  Are you still on Drupal 7? There are only seven months left of support and updates remaining!
---

It's June, so there's only seven months left of security updates for Drupal 7.

Originally released in 2011, Drupal 7 is now on version 7.101 and there are still over 315,000 active Drupal 7 websites according to the project page on Drupal.org.

Are you stuck on D7 or haven't upgraded yet?

I'm interested to know why. Reply to this email and let me know.

Will you be migrating to Drupal 10, or something else?

If you need help, with [my Drupal 7 upgrade roadmap][roadmap], I'll create an individual plan to upgrade and enjoy easy upgrades to Drupal 11 and beyond!
