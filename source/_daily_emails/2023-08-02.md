Next week, I'll be presenting a lightning talk at the North West Drupal user group (NWDUG)'s August meetup.

It'll be a crash course into automated testing and test-driven development with Drupal, in which I plan to show how to get started by writing and running your first automated tests whilst exploring the different types of tests that are available.

It's an online event, so if you'd like to see this and other lightning talks on the 8th of August, RSVP at <https://www.meetup.com/nwdrupal/events/293429104>.
