    Drupal 7 is supported for a few more months, but changes to its security policy came into effect on Thursday.
---

As announced in the Drupal 7 end-of-life announcement, changes have been made to the Drupal 7 security support policies - effective the 1st of August.

In summary:

* The Drupal Security Team may post moderately critical and less critical issues affecting Drupal 7 in the public issue queue, as long as they are not mass-exploitable.
* Drupal 7 branches of unsupported modules and themes are no longer eligible for new maintainership.
* PHP 5.5 and below will no longer be supported on Drupal 7 (PHP 5.5 was end-of-life in July 2016).
* Security fixes will no longer be provided for Drupal 7 Windows-only issues.

[There is more information in the announcement][0], but if you're still on Drupal 7, now is the time to upgrade before its end-of-life date in five months.
