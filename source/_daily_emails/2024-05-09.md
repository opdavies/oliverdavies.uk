    Do you have a deadline or a goal?
---

Does your task or project have a deadline for completion?

Is there a date that it must be completed by?

Or, is your "deadline" an arbitrary date that can be moved?

If so, you don't have a deadline.

You have a goal.

Understand and be clear whether you have a fixed deadline or a flexible goal.
