  When fixing a bug, do you try to replicate it with a test?
---

When fixing a bug, can you write a new failing test to replicate the bug?

If so, you verify the bug exists, you know when it's fixed (the test passes), and you know you won't introduce the same bug again - otherwise, the new test will fail.
