  Don't just copy and paste.
---

Whether you get [a solution from AI][0], GitHub, Stack Overflow or somewhere else, don't blindly copy and paste it.

Validate and verify it's the right solution.

Process and understand it and its pros and cons so you can decide why and when to use it again in the future.

Once you've committed it, you're responsible for it and need to maintain it - regardless of where it came from.
