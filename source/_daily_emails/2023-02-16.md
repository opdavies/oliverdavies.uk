Tonight I was lucky to speak at the first [Bristol Software Development Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/south-wales-tech/events/291092930), organised by South Wales Tech.

Following a great talk from Tom Vaughan, I gave an updated version of my [Taking Flight with Tailwind CSS](https://www.oliverdavies.uk/talks/taking-flight-with-tailwind-css) talk.

It's a talk that I first gave in January 2018 and one that I need to continuously update so that it's up to date with the latest version of the framework. The last time I gave this talk was in February 2021 so there was quite a lot of new things to cover.

I was also able to show my recent [Tailwind versions of Bootstrap components](https://bootstrap-with-tailwind.oliverdavies.uk) as a demonstration at the end of the talk.

I'm glad to have had the opportunity to test out the updated version before [Norfolk Developers conference](https://nordevcon.com) next week and I'm looking forward to attending more South Wales Tech events in Swansea and Bristol in the future.
