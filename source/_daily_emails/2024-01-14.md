    Is code a liability or an asset? The more you write, the more you need to maintain.

Something I mentioned during my [podcast episode with Mike Karthauser][episode] is a quote I saw recently:

> Code is a liability, not an asset.

The more code you write, the more you have to maintain.

The more complex the code is, the harder it is to maintain.

For example, when adding a new page to a Drupal application, should you write a custom route, a Controller, and a Repository and write accompanying tests, or should you use the Views module?

Both can give the same result.

One involves writing and maintaining custom code; the other uses a no-code approach available in Drupal, which creates the page and output based on your selections.

There isn't a correct answer.

The option you choose will depend on what problem you're solving, what deadlines you're working to, and any precedents set within the project.

It also depends on whether you want to maintain the code you write over time, fix any bugs, refactor it, and upgrade it as part of major Drupal version upgrades.

Like a house, car or pet, any code you write will need ongoing care and maintenance in the future - not just now.
