  Always review your staged changes before committing.
---

[In yesterday's email][0] where I wrote about `git stash`, I mentioned the `-p` or `--patch` options.

When stashing changes, this allows you to interactively select which changes you want to stash and what you don't.

This is supported by other Git commands, including `git add`.

I always use `git add -p` when adding changes as it gives me the chance to review them before committing them.

If I left any stray comments, debug code, trailing spaces or anything I don't want to commit, I can remove them.

If I was working on multiple changes (which I avoid), I can select the appropriate changes and create commits related to each change to keep the history clean and useful.

I also use `git diff` and `git diff --staged` to review changes as well as `git show` to review commits.

By doing this, I know my commits will be in the best state for others to review now or for me to review if I need to in the future.
