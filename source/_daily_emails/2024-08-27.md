  Build Configs is now released as open-source software on GitHub.

Build Configs - the tool I wrote to generate build configuration files for projects - is [now released as open-source software on GitHub][0].

I wrote it to generate configuration files, such as PHPUnit, PHPStan and PHPCS files, Dockerfiles, Docker Compose files and others, for personal and client projects - namely Drupal, Symfony and Sculpin projects - instead of writing them by hand every time and making them easier to maintain.

I've used it for my [Docker examples on GitHub][3] done [live streams where I've re-explored Behat][2] and [given talks on the project][1], so it made sense to open-source it and release it publicly.

There are still more I'd like to do with it, including improving documentation and adding examples, but if you'd like to contribute to it, contributions and pull requests are welcome.
