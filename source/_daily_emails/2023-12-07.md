In the latest episode of the Beyond Blocks podcast, Ed Crompton and I discuss his case study of upgrading 15 websites for Oxfam on how to build and test a multilingual, multisite Drupal migration.

We discussed focussing on delivering value, prioritising based on usefulness to users and stakeholders, Agile vs agile, and how they pivoted from a "big bang" approach to delivering rapid increments in smaller batches.
