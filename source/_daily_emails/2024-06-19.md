    TIL
---

As a continuous learner, I always try to learn and incorporate new things into my development workflow.

To keep track of them, I recently started to add them to a TIL.txt file.

It's a simple plain-text file in my wiki directory that I append to when I learn something new, and that I can reference in the future.

Whether it's a useful Drupal module, some API documentation, a Git command or something else, my TIL file is becoming a collection of small but valuable pieces of information.

Here's one I added today:

> When adding links in Drupal's menu UI, as well as using `<nolink>` to create an empty link, you can also use `<button>` to create a keyboard-accessible button. #drupal

I may have learned this before and forgotten it, but, now it's in my TIL file, I have somewhere to keep it.

Always be learning!
