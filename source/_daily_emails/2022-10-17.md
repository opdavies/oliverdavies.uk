Today I saw that my Drupal.org profile is showing that I’ve been on that website for 14 years.

Drupal.org is the online home of the open-source Drupal CMS project, and where I registered to ask questions on the forums as I started to learn Drupal. More recently, it’s been where I’ve uploaded and maintain my own contributed projects and contribute patches to others, including Drupal core.

I even spent time working for the Drupal Association on Drupal.org itself.

I've talked about T-shaped Developers in a previous email, and whilst I've added complementary skills to my toolkit over the years, Drupal has been my main specialism and what I focused on when I started freelancing and later switched careers into software development.

With Drupal 10 just around the corner, I'm looking forward to seeing how Drupal continues to evolve and develop.
