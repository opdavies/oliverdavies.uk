How do you release a new project?

Do you build everything and release everything at once?

I've used the strategy of building and releasing it a page at a time and running two versions simultaneously.

The main live version stays running, and you use a tool like NGINX or Cloudflare as a gatekeeper to direct traffic to the correct application - either the current one or the new one - based on the requested page.

When a page is ready, you add it to the list of pages to serve from the new application to put it live.

If there's an issue, it is also easy to revert to the original page.

I've used this approach with my website and for client Drupal upgrade projects, where some pages are on Drupal 7 and some on Drupal 10.

It's not the right approach for every situation, but it's a useful one to have in the toolkit.
