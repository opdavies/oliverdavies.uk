  Does your website even need JavaScript?
---

I've been through several iterations of my website over the years and used different technologies.

The first versions were on Drupal 6 and 7 before I started to explore static site generators like Jekyll and Sculpin.

One version was written with a JavaScript-based static site generator, but it needed a lot of JavaScript to render a simple HTML website.

The current version has no JavaScript at all.

There is no analytics script, carousels or fancy transitions.

I keep the functionality as simple as possible.

It's fast, accessible and responsive.

If I'm considering adding something, I ask "do I really need this?".

What impact will it have? Positive or negative.

Do I want to take on the overhead of maintaining it?

If not, I don't add it.

If you don't already ask this in your projects, start.
