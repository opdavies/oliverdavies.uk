  I think Tailwind CSS is not only a great CSS framework, but a great way to learn CSS itself.

I was in a pair programming session today, working on some Twig components with Tailwind CSS.

We knew what we needed to implement and did so based on an example from a Tailwind component library and some additional styles.

After implementing the feature, we could review the classes we added and review what each did.

We could easily move or remove a class and see what effect it had.

Something nice is that the Tailwind classes usually relate to what CSS they're applying, such as `block` and `flex` for `display` and `relative` and `absolute` for positioning.

This makes Tailwind a great way to learn CSS compared to other frameworks that give you prebuilt HTML and expect you to add a generic class like `card`.

In that case, the knowledge is hidden within a stylesheet the Developer doesn't see, which makes it harder to read and learn from.

Other utility-class frameworks have shorter class names that are less readable.

Tailwind strikes the perfect balance, in my opinion.
