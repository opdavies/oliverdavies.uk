    What is a bug-free guarantee?
---

[All of my software development proposals and services][0] include a bug-free guarantee.

What does that mean?

For a set period after the code is delivered, if it's broken or doesn't work as you expect, I'll fix it.

For free.

You just let me know, and I'll make it work.

No additional charges, invoices or change requests.

Just working code.
