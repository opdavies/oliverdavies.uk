My most recent guest on the Beyond Blocks podcast is PHP Developer, public speaker and PHP South West organiser, Dave Liddament.

We discuss using PHPStan and static analysis in PHP projects as well as taking some trips down memory lane, including when we wrote the most recent PHP website with Tailwind CSS version 0.4. That is not a typo!
