Do you deploy changes to production on Fridays?

Some people don't as they're worried about potential issues occurring over the weekend.

When's the last time you did a deployment which caused a issue 24 or 48 hours later?

In my experience, most issues are visible immediately or shortly after a deployment and not days later.

Deploying on a Friday may not be as risky as you think.
