Are you near London and want to learn about automated testing in Drupal?

I'll be presenting a session and Q&A on automated testing and test-driven development in Drupal.

This is one of my favourite topics to present and teach, so I'm looking forward to this event.

If you want to attend, [RSVP on the meetup event page][0].

If you can't, check out my [free Drupal testing email course][1] or [book a 1-on-1 consulting call][2] and I'll get you started.
