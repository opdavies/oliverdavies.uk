    This week is a new School of Code cohort, and I'm excited to be mentoring again.
---

Tomorrow is the first day of cohort 17 of School of Code - a free 16-week software development bootcamp - and I'm happy to be mentoring a student again for my third time.

I also mentored the winning team at a hack day event in January and [spoke at the TechConnect meetup][0] last year.

Last week, I spoke with George Gordon - a recent School of Code graduate who I met at the hack day and later at another meetup I was speaking at.

We discussed his experience with coding bootcamps, getting into the software industry and involved with community events and how he found his first Developer job!

It will be released soon on [the Beyond Blocks podcast page][1].
