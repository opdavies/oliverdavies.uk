  What checks do you run in your CI pipeline?
---

As well as [committing build artifacts][0], another common use for CI pipelines is for running automated checks.

This could include code linting, static analysis, automated tests, checking for security vulnerabilities, and more.

Instead of relying on Developers running these checks manually, running them automatically in a CI pipeline ensures they're run regularly and that each commit is deployable.

If all the checks pass, a commit can be promoted and released.

If not, the commit should not be deployed and it should be fixed.

This makes a CI pipeline and automated checks vital to ensure the quality of your software, to identify regressions, and to avoid promoting and releasing broken code.
