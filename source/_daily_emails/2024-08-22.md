  The new version of Drush is using Laravel Prompts.

Whilst starting to upgrade my [automated testing email course][0] to Drupal 11, I needed to update Drush and [noticed the output was different][1].

People replied to that post, saying Drush was now using Laravel Prompts.

I've seen the conference talk [where Jess Archer unveiled Laravel Prompts][2] at Laracon EU, but wasn't aware it was being used by Drush.

It's great to see Laravel Prompts being used in other PHP projects, which was one of Jess' main objectives, and the Drupal ecosystem continuing to [get off the island][3].
