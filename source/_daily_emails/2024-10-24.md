  `git stash` is underrated.
---

`git stash` is one of the commands I use the most.

Maybe because I do trunk-based development so I very rarely create new branches, or because I intentionally make and push small atomic commits, I often find myself using `git stash` whilst debugging something or if I need to switch contexts quickly whilst in the middle of another task and I don't want to lose my changes.

If it's not something I'm going to unstash and bring back almost immediately, I can create a new branch or create a named stash with `git stash save <name>`.

If I don't need to stash everything, it supports the `-p` or `--patch` option and I can decide what to stash and what to keep.

If you haven't used `git stash`, I recommend giving it a try.
