    Today, I used my Build Configs tool to easily switch a project from one web server to another.

Have you been in a situation where you needed to switch something in a project, like the type of database or a payment provider?

Today, I decided to switch a project from NGINX to Apache.

Usually, this would involve using a different base Docker image, creating new configuration files, and changing things like the root directory for my project.

But, because I'd built this into [Build Configs], I was able to change a few lines in one file, and when I re-generated the configuration files, this project was running Apache.

This is an excellent example of why I built this tool: to save time and reduce duplication across my projects.

For this change, it did both.
