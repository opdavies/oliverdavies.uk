  Why I no longer create different Git branches for every change, and why I switched to trunk-based development.
---

A few days ago, I asked [why people are still using Git Flow in 2024][previous].

I moved to trunk-based development two years ago and haven't looked back.

## Why did I do that?

Only having a single branch instead of separate `main` and `develop` branches and branches for each feature and fix is much simpler.

I don't get merge conflicts when trying to merge branches together, as everything is on a single branch.

A couple of years ago, I was working on two features for a project. I was demoing them to a client and broke my local environment when switching branches from feature A to feature B.

It was embarrassing, and it took me time to resolve the issues before I could continue working.

## Here's the thing

Working mostly on a single branch avoids merge conflicts, saves time, and simplifies my workflow.

No more confusion, merge conflicts or broken demos.
