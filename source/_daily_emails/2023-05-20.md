Today, in the repository of an open-source project, I saw an issue comment saying, "This is a minor breaking change.".

It detailed what was removed and suggested an alternative.

I don't know how you define a "minor" breaking change.

Is it because it's a single line and easy to replace, or is it part of the code that is rarely used by consumers and less likely to cause an issue?

Regardless, if it's a breaking change, anyone using that project will need to update their code if they use something that was removed, whether it's minor or not.
