A few years ago, decoupled or headless Drupal - where Drupal is used as an API with a separate front-end - was very popular with some large Drupal agencies and clients using it.

[I gave a conference talk][talk] about how to use Drupal as a backend application for a Vue.js frontend.

Recently, though, I haven't heard much about it.

Some previous advocates have moved back to the more traditional approach.

Interestingly, though, I did hear quite a bit about it at DrupalCon and about Drupal and Next.js in particular.

I want to try using Drupal with Astro in the future and see what the landscape is like now.

## What about you?

Do you use Drupal in a decoupled or headless way? If so, what do you use for the frontend?

If not, or if you've moved back to a more traditional approach, why?

Reply and let me know.
