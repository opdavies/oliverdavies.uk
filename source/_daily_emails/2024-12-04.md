Over the next few weeks, I'm going to create another email course, this time about building websites with the [Sculpin static site generator](https://sculpin.io).

I've been using Sculpin since 2015 when [I used it to learn Twig][0] before Drupal 8's release and I use it to generate my website.

I've recently been [speaking about it at user groups][2] like PHP South West, BrumPHP and PHP Berkshire.

Similar to my [automated testing email course][1], this will send a lesson every day straight to your inbox and will show how to build a website with Sculpin from scratch.

If you want to be added when it's ready or have questions, reply to this email and let me know.
