    Drupal 11 is here!
---

Yesterday, the 2nd of August 2024, Drupal 11 was released.

The next major version of the Drupal content management system and the newest major version since Drupal 10 on the 15th of December 2022.

There are some requirement changes, such as newer versions of PHP and MySQL, and updated PHP dependencies, such as a newer version of Symfony, PHPUnit and Twig.

Several Drupal core modules have been moved to contrib modules, making Drupal core simpler and leaner.

## Here's the thing

The same as from 8 to 9 and 9 to 10, it's simple to upgrade to Drupal 11.

I did it with my [Docker Drupal example][0] my changing a few files and running `composer update`.
