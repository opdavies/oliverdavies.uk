    Yesterday, I said feature flags should be short-lived. But how do you know when a flag can be removed?
---

[In yesterday's email][yesterday], I mentioned my recent ["minimum viable feature flag" tweet][tweet] and that I think feature flags should be short-lived.

But how do you know when a feature flag should be removed?

My approach is to add a TODO comment above where I use a feature flag.

In that comment, I added why the feature flag was added and when it can be removed.

It can be something like "Remove this when x is deployed" and/or a targeted date when I'd expect to be able to remove the flag.

Then, when reading through the code, anyone can see when it should be possible to remove each feature flag, and it's easy to find flags that can be removed by reviewing the TODO comments.
