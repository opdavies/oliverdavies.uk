When working as part of a team, I like to do pair or mob programming as much as possible.

I like being able to give and receive feedback in real-time; everyone can contribute to the solution and more shared knowledge, so there's less siloing, and it's much harder to block multiple people than a single person.

Working in pairs or a mob is a great opportunity to onboard new team members, train and mentor, and share tips and tricks.

It's usually more productive than working separately, and it's nice to speak and socialise with other team members whilst working on a task.
