Marian Kostadinov ([stochnagara on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stochnagara)) replied to Friday's email about DTOs and value objects to tell me about `readonly` classes, which can be done in PHP 8.2.

Looking at the previous class:

```language-php
class AccountDetails {

  public function __construct(
    public readonly string $accountNumber,
    public readonly string $sortCode,
  ) {}
  
}
```

Instead of setting each property as `readonly`, the whole class can instead be marked as `readonly`:

```language-php
readonly class AccountDetails {

  public function __construct(
    public string $accountNumber,
    public string $sortCode,
  ) {}
  
}
```

Thanks for the suggestion, Marian!
