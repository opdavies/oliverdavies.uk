As well as taking longer to fix than locally or in a failed CI pipeline, shipping buggy software to production causes reputational damage.

If an application goes down or doesn't run as expected, it could get noticed by your customers, clients, or your clients' customers.

You want your customers and clients to be assured you're writing the correct software based on their needs and requirements, and doing so with as few bugs and issues as possible.

While there are always bugs in software and occasional unexpected downtime, having these happen regularly can damage your and, if applicable, your client's reputation.

Therefore, it's in everyone's interest to write high-quality and well-tested software.

There will be fewer bugs, and by following practices such as feature flags and continuous integration and delivery, they can be fixed faster.
