    Discussing automation, Linux training and mechanical keyboards with Jochen Lillich.
---

This week, I released the most recent episode of the [Beyond Blocks podcast][0].

My guest this week is Jochen Lillich - the Monospace Mentor, aka geewiz.

Jochen and I discuss content creation, live streaming on Twitch and YouTube, infrastructure automation, Linux, mentoring and, of course, mechanical keyboards.

[Listen to the episode now][1].

I've been a fan of Jochen's content and Twitch streams for a long time, and it was great to meet him at DrupalCon Lille and have him on the podcast.

I have a few more recorded episodes that will be released over the next few weeks.

If you want to be a guest on Beyond Blocks, [let me know][2].
