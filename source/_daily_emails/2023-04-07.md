After a trip away with the family earlier this week, I was happy to speak at the PHP London meetup yesterday evening.

Following on from my previous "Working from Workspace" talk, I spoke about my current development setup for my personal and work laptops with Nix and NixOS, Linux, Neovim, tmux, just, Docker and more!

Of course, I spoke about PHP, Drupal, and Symfony too as well as some of the work that we're doing at Transport for Wales.

I learned that the call for papers for the PHP UK conference 2024 is already open so I'll definitely be submitting some proposals for next year's conference. Hopefully, I'll be back in London again before that.
