This week's guest on the Beyond Blocks podcast is joined by Nick Janetakis - a Software Developer, Docker Captain and Teacher who focuses on building and deploying web apps.

I'm a long-time consumer of Nick's content via his blog, YouTube channel and courses, so it was great to discuss Docker, content creation and more with him.
