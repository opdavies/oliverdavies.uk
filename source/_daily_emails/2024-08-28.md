In the most recent episode of the [Beyond Blocks podcast][0], I spoke with [Sam Mortenson][1] about Single File Components in Drupal as well as building static Drupal websites with Tome.

As a Drupal Specialist who works with other technologies including Vue.js, Symfony and Sculpin, it was great to discuss and learn more about both topics.

[Listen to the episode now][2].
