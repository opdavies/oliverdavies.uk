The Drupal Association recently launched the "Adopt a Document" program for Drupal.org, making documentation pages available for adoption.

From [the blog post](https://www.drupal.org/about/starshot/blog/adopt-a-document-new-program-to-bring-drupal-documentation-to-the-next-level):

> Inspired by the “Adopt a Highway” program that is becoming more and more popular in North America, we created a way for the partners to get involved in creating great documentation by taking care of one of the Drupal CMS milestones and sponsoring creation and further maintenance of the documentation for one or multiple Drupal CMS working tracks.
>
> Thanks to your support, future users of Drupal CMS will be able to easily find answers to the questions that might arise as they discover Drupal CMS capabilities.

I think this is a great way for Drupal's documentation to continue improving and to give companies another way to contribute to the Drupal project.

If you were looking for a way to contribute to Drupal, this may be a good option.
