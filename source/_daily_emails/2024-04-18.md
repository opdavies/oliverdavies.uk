  This week, I submitted my first change to the LocalGov Microsites distribution.

This week, I submitted [my first change][pr] to the LocalGov Microsites project.

It was a small change - correcting a typo that I spotted within the README file.

It's OK to start small, especially when first working on a new codebase.

It was a good introduction to the project and the first of what I hope to be numerous contributions to the Microsites distribution and LocalGov Drupal in general.
