This week, I'm starting my own podcast - [Beyond Blocks][podcast].

I'll be interviewing different people in every week, focussing on Drupal and related software development topics.

I have the first guests lined up, including some speakers from last month's DrupalCon Europe conference, where we can discuss their topics in more detail.

If you'd like to be a guest, [get in touch][form] and let me know what you'd like to discuss.
