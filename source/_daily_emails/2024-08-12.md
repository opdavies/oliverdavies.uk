  Always write your code as if...

There's a famous programming quote (and variations of it):

> Always code as if the (person) who ends up maintaining your code will be a
violent psychopath who knows where you live. Code for readability.

I believe [it comes from this Google thread](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.lang.c++/c/rYCO5yn4lXw/m/oITtSkZOtoUJ).

I'm currently working on some Drupal 7 code I first committed to in May 2014.

That person could also be you!
