    How can you prove a concept?
---

How do you validate an idea from a client or stakeholder?

Unlike a minimum viable product, which is the smallest amount of functionality for a feature to be released, a proof of concept is an initial investigation into whether the idea is viable.

What's the least amount of development you can do to prove the concept?

Can you create something using a smaller data set or with simplified functionality?

What can you build within a minimal timeframe so, if the idea isn't used, too much time wasn't invested in it, but still verifies it?

Do you need to write any code or do any development at all?

All we need to do is find out if the concept could work.
