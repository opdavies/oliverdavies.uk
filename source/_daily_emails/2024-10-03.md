  You aren't gonna need it.
---

I like to keep my code simple.

I only write the code I need to add the functionality I need, and I only include the current requirements.

There's no benefit to writing code for additional requirements that may never be needed or used.

I also think this when adding new modules or packages, or implementing a design pattern.

Do I really need this?

What value does it add?

Is there a simpler way to achieve the same thing?

If so, I'm happy to call YAGNI on it.
