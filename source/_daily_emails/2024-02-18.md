This week on the Beyond Blocks podcast, I'm joined by Mark Conroy - Director of Development at Annertech to discuss all things front-end development and building something useful in one day.

[Listen now][episode]

## Talking points

- Building better websites faster, including Drupal distributions, such as LocalGov.
- What Drupal gives you out of the box and using the right tool for the job.
- Drupal migrations and migrating Drupal configuration from a spreadsheet.
- Saving time and improving efficiency by standardising base builds with Docksal and Composer.
- How to build projects, like the Running Plan Generator, in a day and training for 10Ks and marathons.
- Prioritising tasks.
- Annertech's development workflow and standardisation by developing on remote servers.
- Why you may not need preprocessors and complicated front-end build tools, and reducing complexity using vanilla CSS, JavaScript and web components.
- Lowering the barrier to entry to contribute to open-source projects.
- Building a design system/component library with web components.
- The Content Access by Path module that was developed for Essex County Council.
