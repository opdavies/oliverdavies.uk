  Do you consider local development sites as pre-production environments? They need to be updated, too!
---


A few days ago, I asked [how many pre-production environments][0] you have for your software application.

But did you include each Developer's local environment?

Each developer will have a development environment - either on their computer or a development server - to write and initially test their code before it's deployed to a test, staging or production environment.

## Here's the thing

Each Developer's local or development site is an environment too.

They also [need to be easily updatable][1] and consistent with the other environments, but they are often overlooked or forgotten.

When was the last time you or your Developers updated your local environment?
