  Drupal's Experience Builder project adopts ADRs.

Today I noticed that Drupal's Experience Builder project [has adopted architectural decision records][0].

From the issue:

> I proposed [...] to start adopting ADRs to document decisions that were made. That’d allow us to stop rehashing past conversations and allow people to onboard with fewer meetings.
> … or so I think.
> Because I think that ADRs could be an excellent way to scale this project up to A) many people, B) many timezones.

I like this decision and have adopted and [written about ADRs before][1].

I also like that the documents [are stored as markdown files in the repository][2], alongside the code, making it easy for everyone to view or change.

As the work on Experience Builder continues, new contributors can read these documents and understand why previous decisions were made, which is extremely valuable.

I'm interested to see how ADRs work for the Experience Builder project and whether they're adopted more widely in other parts of the Drupal ecosystem.
