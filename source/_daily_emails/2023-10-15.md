This week, I'll be in Lille, France for DrupalCon Europe, where I'm presenting a session on automated testing and test-driven development in Drupal.

I'll be taking a short break from these emails to enjoy the conference, focus on my talk, and finish my <a href="{{site.url}}/atdc">free email course on automated testing in Drupal</a>.
