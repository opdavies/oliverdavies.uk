  I was recently happy to see that the Override Node Options module is used by LocalGov Drupal in their microsites distribution!

[In yesterday's email][0], I showed some of the usage numbers of the Override Node Options module and how the current numbers match those around a year ago.

Whilst the overall numbers are similar, there are a lot less Drupal 7 installations of the module and around the same number more Drupal 8+ installations.

Somewhere I was happy to see it being used recently is within the [LocalGov Drupal microsites distribution][1].

It's great when being brought into a project to see your modules being used, but it's fantastic to see a module I maintain and code that I wrote being used by a large distribution like LocalGov Drupal and benefiting local councils and people in the UK and Ireland.
