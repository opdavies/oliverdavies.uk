  I use open source software to build open source software.
---

As well as using [free and open source software for my homelab][0], I develop software applications for clients using open source software, such as PHP, Drupal, Symfony and Sculpin.

I also use open source software to do this.

I use [NixOS as the operating system on my laptop][1].

I use Alacritty as my terminal emulator and tmux as a terminal multiplexer to have different sessions, windows and tabs for each project.

I write my code in Neovim and use various additional plugins.

I use Git for source control and tools like PHPStan, PHPUnit and Pest to run checks on my code.

[I use Nix and devenv][2] to run the applications locally and host them on Linux servers running Nginx.

I also use OBS, Kdenlive and GIMP to record and edit my content, which are all also open source projects.

I run an open source business, using open source tools and projects and contribute to and [maintain my own open source software projects][3].
