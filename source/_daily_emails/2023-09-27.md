You have two or more environments and versions of your application, but you do trunk-based development, so you only have a single branch that you use on all environments.

But if all environments have the same code, how can we have differences between them?

What if we want a feature enabled on one environment and not the other?

## Feature flags

Feature flags are an approach I've previously written about. You have two branches of logic within your code, and the flow changes based on whether a flag is enabled.

If a flag is enabled, execute the first block of code. Otherwise, execute the second.

Now, you enable and disable the required feature flags for each environment.

**The code is the same for all environments, but the enabled features and functionality are different.**

Then, once the feature has been deployed and released in production, the feature flag can be removed.
