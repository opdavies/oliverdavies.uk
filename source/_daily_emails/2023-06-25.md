Something I've been asked before is "Do you need permission to write automated tests or do Test-Driven Development?".

A response I heard recently was "Does a surgeon ask if they can wash their hands before operating?".

The same as when I take my car to a garage, I expect the mechanic to do the appropriate diagnostic, repair work and testing to make it's working correctly and safely.
