    Newport City Council is now the first Welsh council to use LocalGov Drupal.
---

Last week, it was announced that Newport City Council's (my local council) website is now running on LocalGov Drupal - a distribution for council websites.

This increases the total to 44 councils in the UK and Ireland.

Newport is the first Welsh council to use it and the first LocalGov website to be bilingual, serving content in both English and Welsh.

It's great to see Drupal adoption continue to grow in Wales and within the Welsh public sector, and LocalGov being adopted by more councils across the UK and Ireland.

I think LocalGov Drupal is a great project and one [I've contributed to previously](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_alert_banner/pull/225), and I plan to do more in the future.
