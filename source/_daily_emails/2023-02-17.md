Today I upgraded my [Drupal Docker example](https://github.com/opdavies/docker-examples/tree/main/drupal) to Drupal 10.

Admittedly, it's a simple project, but upgrading from Drupal 9 to 10 was a straightforward process.

I had to remove the Examples module as there's no Drupal 10 compatible version yet, but updating to Drupal 10 only needed me to change the version constraints in the `composer.json` file and run the `composer update` command.

After completing a number of Drupal 7 upgrade projects which involve migrating content, rewriting custom modules, and rebuilding themes, it's great to be able to upgrade between major modern versions with a few simple commands.
