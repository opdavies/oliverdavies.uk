  What are err, req and res?
---

Today, I was at another School of Code hackathon event, mentoring a team of three Developers as they planned and built an application within a day.

During the day, we looked at some example documentation that included variable names like `err`, `req`, and `res`.

I don't like short variable names like this.

I'd suggest calling them what they are - `error`, `request` and `response`.

This makes the code clearer and easier to read and understand, particularly if you aren't using types and need additional context.

Readability is important as [people read more code than they write][0].
