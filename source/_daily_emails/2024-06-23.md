  Drupal 10.3 released
---

Last week, Drupal 10.3 was released.

It's the final feature release of Drupal 10, with Drupal 11 to be released this year.

As it's a minor release, it provides improvements and new functionality and does not break backward compatibility (BC) for public APIs, so it should be easy to upgrade from Drupal 10.2.

An interesting change is that you **need to upgrade to Drupal 10.3 prior to upgrading to Drupal 11**. This is similar to Symfony's upgrade cycle and will make upgrading to Drupal 11, which will be refined version of Drupal 10 with a very similar public API, much easier.

## What about Drupal 10.4

There will still be a Drupal 10.4 release in December, and will be the first maintenance minor version, receiving limited forward-compatible and security fixes only, and will be supported until the release of Drupal 12 in 2026.

It's great to see the project evolve, and I'm looking forward to upgrading my projects to Drupal 10.3 and then 11 in the near future.
