  I wrote my Build Configs project so I only write a file once, but can re-use it as many times as needed.

I built my [Build Configs] tool because I only wanted to write a file once and re-use it instead of writing it over again or copying and pasting between projects.

Having standardised templates for different languages and project types, I can easily set up new projects and get them running in a few minutes.

If I need to add a feature or fix a bug, I can do it once in the Build Configs tool and easily regenerate the configuration files for all projects, and they'll all get the updated files.

There's no "I need to copy this feature from project A or this bug fix from project B." when starting on project C.

As I only work on fixed-price engagements, it's in my interest to be able to create and maintain projects in a fast and efficient manner.

The Build Configs tool enables me to do that.
