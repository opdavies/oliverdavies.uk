  Is it a chore to write automated tests?
---

[Do some Developers skip writing tests for their personal projects][0] because they think it's a chore?

If they've written the code, so they then think it's too much work to write tests or need to move on to the next task?

Is it boring to write tests for code that's already written and will pass straight away?

This is why I do test-driven development and start with a failing test and then write code to make it pass.

Then, I add more to the test until it fails and then get that to pass.

When that test is finished, I'll move to a new test for a different piece of functionality.

I like this approach of working in small feedback cycles and alternating between failing and passing tests.

Testing this way isn't boring or a chore and much more interesting for me compared to writing all the code first and maybe writing the tests later.
