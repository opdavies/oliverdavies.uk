In [today's episode of the Beyond Blocks podcast][episode], I'm joined by Eirik Morland - the Developer of [Violinist].

We discuss why you'd want to use a tool like Violinist to manage your dependency updates, why you'd want to automate repetitive tasks and focus on providing value for clients and customers.

We also discuss running a SaaS business and why Drupal is a good choice for SaaS products - though this could be a full episode on its own.
