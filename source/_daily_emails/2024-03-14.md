    Should we remove the version number from Drupal's marketing materials and standardise how we refer to legacy and modern versions of Drupal?
---

Today, I've been following a conversation on Twitter and reading a blog post about Drupal naming and removing the version number from promotional materials.

In the post, the author recommends stopping using the version number and "just say Drupal" and referring to Drupal 7 and older as "Legacy Drupal".

Here's a quote from the article that stood out to me:

> This is no longer true! We have successfully eliminated the need for organizations to leave Drupal because “it’s cheaper to just rebuild it in Wordpress than upgrade from 8 to 9 or from 9 to 10.” We’ve made it easier for our clients to spend less on major upgrades, we should be proud!

Another suggestion was to also use the term "Modern Drupal" for anything since Drupal 8.

I've been doing this or calling it "Drupal 8+" on streams and podcast episodes, but I like this approach and I'm going to standardise on this, help change the perception of Drupal and that large rebuilds are no longer needed to upgrade as they were between the older legacy versions.
