  Drupal has evolved over the years, so why do a lot of people remember old versions?
---

I started learning software and web development with HTML and CSS in 2007. Then I started with PHP and soon after started to learn Drupal 6 (or maybe 5).

A lot of Developers' first programming language was PHP and maybe used earlier versions of Drupal before moving to another CMS, framework or language.

They still remember, though, how things were when they used it and aren't aware of the advancements and improvements that have been made.

The PHP language itself has improved significantly in recent versions with new features and much better peformance.

Drupal is more powerful with a lot more available in core compared to when I started to use it and, since adopting modern PHP approaches and third-party code in Drupal 8, writing custom Drupal modules is different with fewer Drupalisms and more industry-standard approaches.

If there's a tool you haven't tried for a while, maybe take another look and see if it's improved since you last used it.
