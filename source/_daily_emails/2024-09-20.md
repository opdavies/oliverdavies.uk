  However you write code, be consistent.
---

Whether you [prefer strict code or not][0], [use snake-case or camel-case for variable names][1] or [how you write your test methods][2], it is important to be consistent in how code is written.

If you're working in a file that uses snake-case variable names, you should do the same and follow the same conventions.

When reading a file, everything should be consistent and seem like it was written by the same person following the same approaches.

Otherwise, when you need to add to or refactor this code in the future, it will be harder to do so.

Consistency is key.
