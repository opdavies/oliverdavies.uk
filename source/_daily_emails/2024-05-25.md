    Writing automated tests is a reusable skill.
---

I like skills and technologies that I can re-use.

If there's a solution that's only available in one framework and another that is framework-agnostic, I'll use the agnostic one, if possible.

I'd rather invest my time learning something I'll be able to re-use and get the most benefit from.

Automated testing is an example of something re-usable.

Regardless of the CMS, framework or language, how to write and structure automated tests is the same, and you still get the benefits from writing them and/or doing test-driven development.

Whilst the syntax can be different, even in the PHP space comparing PHPUnit, Pest and Behat, the fundamentals and approaches are the same.
