    As promised, I've added some tests to the Content Access by Path module.
---

Last month, I released the [Beyond Blocks podcast episode][episode] where I spoke with Mark Conroy.

We spoke about a number of things, including the 'Content Access by Path' Drupal module he wrote, and I promised I'd write some automated tests for it as there weren't any at the time.

[Yesterday on my Friday live stream][stream], I installed the module and learnt how it works whilst writing some automated tests.

As is common, the first test took a little while to do as I got the setup steps working and learned how the module worked. Once that was passing, adding the others was fairly straight forward.

After the stream, I [created an issue][issue] with a merge request to add the tests I wrote and enabling GitLab CI so they'll be automatically run for any other changes.

Hopefully, it'll be reviewed soon, but I've done what I promised, contributed to more open-source software, learned more about a new module and, hopefully, others will have learned things from the stream too.
