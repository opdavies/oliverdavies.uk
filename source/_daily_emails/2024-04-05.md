    Drupal works well for small and simple applications, as well large and compex applications.

Two of the main things I like about Drupal are its flexibility and scalability.

It works well for basic applications, such as personal websites and blogs (like mine) and for large, complex applications such as Drupal.org itself and many others.

I don't need to learn one tool for small or simple projects and another for large or complex projects.

Drupal is one size fits all.
