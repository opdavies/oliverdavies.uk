  Not all legacy code is technical debt.

Technical debt is an overused term with people often referring to any legacy code, outdated dependencies or bugs as technical debt.

Technical debt specifically refers to the future cost when a short-term solution is selected over a more flexible or efficient one.

For example, hard-coding something for now and making it dynamic later.

It's not any code the current Developers didn't write or no longer want to support.
