Do you go back and proactively refactor code you've previously written?

In my experience, once some code is working, it's usually not reviewed again and refactored, and any TODO comments are still there.

If code is refactored, it's usually triggered by adding a new feature or fixing a bug that will be difficult or impossible with the existing code - i.e., make the change easy, then make the easy change.

Very rarely have I seen code be refactored to make it easier to read or change in the future.

Do you proactively refactor code or wait until something forces it to happen?

Do you not refactor code at all once it's been written?

Reply to this email and let me know which and why.
