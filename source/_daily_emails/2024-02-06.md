Last week on the Beyond Blocks podcast, I spoke with Tim Lehnen - CTO and former colleague at the Drupal Association.

We discussed what the Drupal Association is and what it does, how companies and individuals can contribute and support the Association, some recent and upcoming improvements to Drupal.org, Drupal 7's end-of-life, and more.
