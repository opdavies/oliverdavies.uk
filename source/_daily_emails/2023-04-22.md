After using my "build-configs" tool to generate and manage configuration files for several personal and client Drupal projects for the past few months, I'm offering it as a product to purchase.

I can provide an initial Drupal project skeleton built using `build-configs`, and for a recurring monthly amount, ongoing updates and unlimited support via Slack.

I can retrofit it to an existing codebase, but as this will be different every time, I'll need more information to give a price.

See {{site.url}}/build-configs for more information and, as a list subscriber, use the code `dailyconfigs` to get an early-bird discount.
