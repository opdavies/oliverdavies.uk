Contrary to what many think (at least to begin with), releasing small, incremental changes often - maybe daily or weekly - is less risky than larger releases containing weeks or months of changes.

If there is an issue after a large release, diagnosing and fixing it can take longer than a smaller release with fewer changes.

You might have to revert and roll back to the previous release instead of being able to push a fix for a small change.

With a small change, the risk of an issue is much lower as it has less chance to impact any other part of the application and is much easier for others to read, understand and debug.
