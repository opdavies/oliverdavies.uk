    If you still write Sass, why do you do it?
---

Yesterday, I asked [if it's time to stop writing Sass][0].

If you still use Sass and are writing new styles with Sass, I'd like to know why.

Reply to this email and let me know.

I'm working on a project and migrating from the existing Sass styles to Tailwind CSS-generated utility classes, but with CSS custom properties (variables) and other Sass-like features now supported by browsers, writing vanilla CSS again is an interesting option.
