It was announced this week at DrupalCon that the end-of-life date for Drupal 7 has been extended until the 5th of January 2025, giving another year for people to upgrade the 40,000+ Drupal 7 websites.

Whilst there's no official announcement yet, it seems this is the final extension and will be when support ends.

Of course, it doesn't mean all of the contributed modules, themes and distributions will be supported or updated until then, but this will give additional time to plan and migrate the remaining Drupal 7 websites whilst still giving clarity by setting a final date that will not be extended again.

If you're still on Drupal 7 and need to learn more about upgrading to Drupal 10, [book an advisory call]({{site.url}}/call) or [an upgrade roadmap]({{site.url}}/drupal7) for your Drupal 7 project.
