Today I was writing Pulumi code in Typescript, and I although I have autocompletion, I mistyped the name of a property.

But, because of the types that I'd declared and how I have Neovim configured, the error was immediately shown, and I was able to fix the typo and what would have been a compilation error if I'd tried to run it.

It only took a second or two for me to make and fix the mistake.

I didn't need to run the code or commit it and push it to a CI pipeline to find out that there was a bug.

I found out and fixed it immediately, and moved on as if I hadn't written the typo at all. This is why I like types and static analysis.
