This week on the Beyond Blocks podcast, I spoke with George Gordon - a graduate from the School of Code who was recently employed in their first Junior Developer role - about their move into tech and software development, their experiences at hack days and meetups, and their introduction to Drupal.

I've been a mentor for School of Code for the last few cohorts as well as attending on-site events such as the TechConnect meetup and hack days.

I wasn't George's mentor, but I met him at a hackday earlier this year and at a PHP meetup a few months later, so I was happy to have him on the podcast.
