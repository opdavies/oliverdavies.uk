  I'm using open source software all the way down.
---

As someone who develops with open-source software such as Drupal, Symfony, and Sculpin and uses Linux to [host my applications][1] and [configure my laptop][2], I've recently started to explore creating a home lab and self-hosting services based on other open source software.

I've started using Jellyfin for media management and playback, Immich for photos, Gitea for hosting my private Git repositories, and Tube Archivist for backing up YouTube videos.

There are a lot of other popular applications that people self-host that I want to look at, as well as maybe hosting my own website.

I've removed proprietary note-taking applications [in favour of plain text files][0] and continued searching for free and open source alternatives to services I've used.

My ethos is to be open source first and to favour an open source solution if there is one.

And if there isn't, I can write one.

As well as creating free and open source software, I want to use it as much as I can as well as using open source software to create my open source software.
