Upgrading from Drupal 7 to 8, 9 or 10 is a large task.

You must create a new empty site, migrate your configuration and data, manually recreate anything else and rewrite any custom modules and themes.

Since Drupal 8, things have been different.

You can upgrade your site in place.

No large code rewrite or data migration.

Many contributed modules support multiple major Drupal versions simultaneously, so they may not need upgrading.

Others may need small changes to remove deprecated code or be compatible with breaking changes, and some tools can automate some or all of the changes.

The same applies to upgrading from Drupal 9 to 10, which will be the same for Drupal 11 next year.
