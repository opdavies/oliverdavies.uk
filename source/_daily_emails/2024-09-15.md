As someone who works on multiple Drupal applications, I know it can be tricky to keep on top of all the available updates.

So, I'm building a SaaS project to display all your available updates in one place.

If you're a freelancer or work for an agency or any team that works on multiple Drupal applications, this could be useful for you.

If this is you, I'm looking for alpha testers to help me test it.

If you're interested, reply and let me know.
