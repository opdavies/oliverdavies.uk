  Would you join an online group Drupal contribution session?
---

I enjoy and advocate for pair and mob programming, and the benefits they offer when working in a team - sharing knowledge whilst onboarding and upskilling the team members, whilst also getting continuous real-time feedback and review of the code that's being written.

I'm also an open-source maintainer and contributor.

I've contributed code to Drupal core.

I've written and maintain Drupal projects, such as the Override Node Options module and the Tailwind CSS starter kit theme.

I've been a mentor for first-time contributors at several DrupalCon events, helping them get started contributing to Drupal core.

Usually, the initial problems are finding an issue to work on and how to get started.

Something I've been considering organising are **online Drupal mob contribution sessions**, where people can work on tasks together in a mob programming approach.

Not working on Drupal applications (although, I offer [paid pair programming sessions][0]), this would be for contributing to Drupal core, contrib projects, or initiatives like Starshot or LocalGov Drupal.

If you have ideas or feedback, or if this is something you'd be interested in attending, reply and let me know!
