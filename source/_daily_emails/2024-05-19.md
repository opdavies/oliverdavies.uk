  If you write better commit messages, you'll get better pull requests.
---

If you're working on a team or project that uses pull or merge requests, then [writing commit messages with detailed descriptions][0] using the message body and not just the subject line, will result in better pull requests.

Whatever text you put in the message body will be used as the description for your pull or merge request, as well as the subject line being used for the title.

So, instead of writing the message after completing the work, when you may forget important details, write it at the time in the message when writing the commit and re-use it in the PR or MR.

Pull or merge requests with more information and detail are more likely to be accepted and merged.

The text will also remain in the pull or merge request, even if [someone squashes your commits and deletes the old messages][1].

The issue then is, [what if you move to a different Git hosting service][2]?
