I recently received these kind words from Frank Landry, who recently completed my [Drupal automated testing email course][course]:

> The course was very informative.
>
> One of the biggest pain points with Drupal testing was that there was no clear and definitive guide on setting up the php unit XML file to get functional and kernel tests working right away.
>
> Your guide was fantastic and I will definitely be using it going forward in my module development for work.

Thanks, Frank, for your feedback.

It's great to get feedback on my content and to know it's helping and providing value to people.
