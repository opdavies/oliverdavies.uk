If you need to provide estimates for your tasks and intend to write tests, include the time for the tests within the estimate.

Don't provide different estimates for testing and the implementation, or with tests and without tests - give one estimate that includes both.

Writing tests and testable code will take longer to begin with, but practice makes perfect and will save time in the long run.
