The video of the most recent version of my [Building static websites with PHP and Sculpin][talk] from February's PHP South West meetup [has been released][video].

In the talk, I explain what Sculpin is and how it works before a live demo where I rebuild part of the PHPSW website (which I worked on originally).

If you have any feedback or questions, reply to this email and let me know.
