  Do you write automated tests for your personal projects?
---

Listening to podcasts and watching videos where Developers talk about their personal or side projects, sometimes they say that they skip writing automated tests.

They'd write tests for their client or work projects, but not necessarily for their own projects.

I wonder why this is.

Presumably they see the benefits of testing on other projects, so why wouldn't they write tests for their own projects?
