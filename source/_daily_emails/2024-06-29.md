    Drupal 10.3 has been released, and Drupal 11 isn't far behind.

[With Drupal 10.3 released][0], Drupal 11 will be the next major version.

There will be a Drupal 10.4, which will be the first minor maintenance version and supported until Drupal 12's release in 2026.

According to [the current development cycle][1], Drupal 11 will be released in a month's time on the 29th of July, with 11.1 in December alongside 10.4.

Drupal 7 will be unsupported as of January 2025.

With Drupal 10 websites needing to be upgraded to 10.3 before 11, it gives people the chance to test their applications on the latest Drupal 10 before upgrading to 11 - a refined version of 10 without the deprecated code.

It also gives module and theme maintainers the opportunity to make their projects compatible before making any breaking changes, meaning upgrades should be more stable as the main changes can be done beforehand.

I'm looking forward to upgrading my applications and projects to Drupal 11, and seeing what's to come in 11.1 and beyond.
