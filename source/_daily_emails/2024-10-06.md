  Is supporting software after its end-of-live date a good idea?

With Drupal 7's end-of-life date of the 5th of January 2025 quickly approaching, I've recently seen again a number of companies offering support for Drupal 7 after its end-of-life date.

I've seen the same in corporate IT environments where they're running versions of software post their EOL date, so it's only Drupal 7, but I wonder if this is a good thing?

Is this deterring companies from upgrading if they know this is an option, or should everyone upgrade and we can move forward from Drupal 7 and other end-of-life software?

According to <https://www.drupal.org/project/usage/drupal>, there are still 281,000 active Drupal 7 installations.

It's considerably less than before - this  time last year, it was over 380,000 installations - but it's still a lot of Drupal 7 being used.
