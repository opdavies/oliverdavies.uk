I recently installed an application called Gitea [on my homelab][0].

It's a service for hosting and managing Git repositories, similar to GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket, but I'm hosting it on my own hardware and I'm in full control of my data.

I've moved all of my client project code from private repositories in the Cloud to my Gitea instance, as well as some of my own private repositories for work-in-progress or archived projects.

I plan to keep my open source project repositories on GitHub and Drupal.org, and use Gitea for personal and client project code, but I may move more to Gitea - like my website code and dotfiles - as time goes on.

And, because I use NixOS for my homelab, installing Gitea was as easy as `services.gitea.enable = true`.

There is also a Docker Compose image and Gitea Cloud, but running something like Gitea for your private code is something I'd like to see more Developers and agencies do.
