  Are you a "real" Software Developer if you don't write automated tests?
---

I remember a while ago, someone could call themselves a "real" Software Developer if they don't write automated tests.

This is, of course, not the case.

But I'd suggest that it makes you a better Developer who writes better and more robust software.
