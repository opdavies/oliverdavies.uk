    How do I know the SpeakerDeck Field module still works on Drupal 10 and 11?
---

[In Wednesday's email][wednesday], I said I was resurrecting the Speakerdeck Field module, and the same version works on Drupal 8, 9, 10 and 11.

How do I know this?

One of my favourite PHP libraries is Rector - a tool for upgrading code to the newest versions of PHP or, in this case, Drupal using Drupal Rector.

It runs automatically on modules, including Speakerdeck Field, via the Project Upgrade Bot and generates a set of updates to apply.

CI pipelines with GitLab CI and a reliable test suite make it much easier to upgrade modules to the latest Drupal version and ensure they still work.
