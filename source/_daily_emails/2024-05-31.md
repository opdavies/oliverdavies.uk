    Do you use AI-based tools in your development workflow?
---

I recently saw articles and videos about an AI service telling people to put glue on pizza and gave a recommended number of rocks to eat every day.

From my understanding, the service had indexed some satirical articles and then returned the information within responses to questions and searches.

As well as the obvious issues with AI returning incorrect or dangerous information in general, this applies to software development as a number of Developers using AI services as coding assistants or pair programming partners, or having it provide AI-powered code completion.

My experience of using AI hasn't been great with it suggesting broken solutions or to use functionality that doesn't exist, so I don't use it often.

If you do, make sure to double-check the results it gives you and use what it gives you as a starting point instead of just copying and pasting it into your code.
