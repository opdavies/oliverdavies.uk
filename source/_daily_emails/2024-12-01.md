  As well as laptop, development environment and server configuration, I've also been using NixOS to build a Homelab.

As well as [my laptop configuration][2], [local development environments][0] and [production server][1], I've also been using Nix for something else recently.

Setting up and configuring a Homelab on an old laptop.

I've been able to install and configure services like Jellyfin for playing video files, Immich for photo hosting and management, Gitea as my own Git server, Vaultwarden for securely storing my passwords and Traefik as a reverse proxy.

Each of these was very easy to configure with only a few lines of the Nix language and avoided a heavy use of Docker which seems common in most Homelab setups.

Next, I'd like to add home automation with Home Assistant and explore running a local DNS server within my network.

I'm looking forward to these, and seeing what else I can add to this setup using Nix and NixOS.
