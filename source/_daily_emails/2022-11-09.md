I’m happy to have had a conference talk proposal accepted for what will be my first in-person conference since DrupalCamp London in February 2020.

I’ll be giving my "[Taking Flight with Tailwind CSS]({{site.url}}/presentations/taking-flight-with-tailwind-css)" talk for the first time since February 2021, and in front of an in-person audience since June 2019.

The talk itself will need some updating. The last time I gave it, Tailwind CSS was on version 2.0.3. It’s now on version 3.2.2 and includes features like the just-in-time engine, arbitrary values and variants, container queries, and a load of new utility classes.

I gave a lot of talks at online events in 2020, so after taking a bit of a break last year, it will be nice to speak in front of an in-person conference audience again.
