Something I'm aware of when working in a pair or mob is to always listen to input from other team members.

A pair or mob session isn't just focused on one person's ideas or solution. It's a collaborative effort based on everyone's input, experience and ideas.

If there are conflicting or different ideas or approaches, they can be discussed, and everyone can agree on the way forward. Approaches may also change as you learn more together during the session.

Together, you will come up with the best solution - even if it's different from what you had in mind to begin with.
