  Today, let's have a look at the Nix programming language.
---

Yesterday, I wrote about [Nix the package manager][0].

To use it, you need to write code in the Nix language in .nix files.

To see an example, you can see [my dotfiles on GitHub][1] as well as lots of other people's that they've published.

It's a functional language so some of the concepts were new to me, but I picked it up fairly quickly and learned some of the paradigms and conventions.

This is the code that installs Nginx on my server:

```nix
services.nginx = {
  enable = true;
  serverNamesHashBucketSize = 256;
};
```

These are some of the packages I have installed on my laptop:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs: {
  devenv
  dog
  git
  go
  jq
  php
  phpPackages.composer
  pv
  tldr
}
```

And this is how to configure processes [in a devenv configuration][2], which is built with Nix:

```nix
processes = {
  tailwind.exec = ''
    cd ${drupal.theme.path}
    watchexec --exts css,twig tailwindcss --config assets/tailwind.config.ts \
      --output dist/tailwind.css
  '';
};
```

Once you have written the configuration, you can run it and install what you've specified, and it will do it the same way every time.

For a crash course in the Nix language, take a look at <https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix-language> or one of the many open-sourced configurations on GitHub.
