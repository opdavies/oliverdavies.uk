    Last week, I attended and spoke at DrupalCamp Ghent in Belgium.
---

Last Friday and Saturday, I was happy to attend and present two sessions at DrupalCamp Ghent in Belgium.

I was able to present talks on automated testing and Tailwind CSS, which were my 99th and 100th talks, respectively!

The sessions were streamed live, or the slides and previous recordings [are on my website][1].

It was a great event and it's always nice to see and meet new people within the Drupal community, to see new places and share knowledge by giving presentations.

Reply and let me know if you have any feedback on the sessions or if you'd like me to present a talk or workshop at your event.
