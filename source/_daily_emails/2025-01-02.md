Another great thing about open source software is anyone can use it, contribute to it or provide services for it.

You don't need to be a large company like Acquia or Red Hat.

I was a self-taught solo hobbyist Developer when I started building a website for my local Tae Kwon-Do club in 2007 with PHP.

In 2008, I started learning Drupal, built my own website and started doing freelance Drupal development and consulting work.

I became a full-time Drupal Developer in 2010 and haven't looked back since.

I was able to this for free using open source software.
