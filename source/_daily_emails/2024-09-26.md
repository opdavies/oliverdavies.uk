  Should you add blank lines in your code?
---

I recently saw a social media post that said something like "Don't add blank lines within functions. They take up space and don't add anything".

I may have misremembered the exact wording, but that was the gist of it.

I like to add blank lines within my functions to create and add separation between logical blocks of code.

Whilst this doesn't add anything for a computer parsing and serving the code, or a CI pipeline performing checks, it makes the code easier for people to read and understand which, it my opinion, adds its own value - even if the functionality is the same.
