  Docblocks or attributes. Which do you prefer?
---

As Drupal 11 uses PHPUnit 10, we can now use the `#[Test]` attribute instead of the `/** @test */` annotation for our test methods.

For example:

```php
// Before.

/** @test */
public function it_returns_the_endpoint()

// After.

#[Test]
public function it_returns_the_endpoint()
```

[Annotations have started to be replaced][0] in parts of Drupal since 10.2, so it's nice to be able to do it with tests, too.

Which do you prefer?
