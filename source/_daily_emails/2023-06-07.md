Following the announcement at DrupalCon, the official announcement has been released regarding Drupal 7's end-of-life extension:

> Today, we are officially announcing that Drupal 7 will reach its end of life on January 5, 2025.
>
> With this final extension, the Drupal Security Team is also adjusting the level of support provided.
>
> This will be the final extension.

If you're involved with one of the ~400,000 Drupal 7 websites (according to https://www.drupal.org/project/usage/drupal), what does the additional year and a half of Drupal 7 mean to you?

Will you use the time to find the budget to upgrade, assemble a migration plan, port any missing contributed modules or refactor your custom modules or theme to make it easier to upgrade?

Is it different knowing it’s the final extension compared to the previous time when it wasn’t known if it would be extended again?

If you're stuck on Drupal 7 or staying on it into 2024 or 2025, what's stopping you from upgrading?
