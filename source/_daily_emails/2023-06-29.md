Having a passing test suite or CI pipeline doesn't tell you if your appliction works.

There could be scenarios or edge-cases that aren't covered within the test suite and contain bugs, but aren't covered by the test suite.

There could be untested code that isn't covered at all.

A passing test suite proves that the tests that have been written so far pass and that there are no regressions introduced by the latest change.

## Here's the thing

Instead of telling you that your application works by passing, the test suite tells you something is broken when it fails.

If a previously-passing test is failing, the application is broken and should not be deployed - not that the application is working if the tests don't fail.
