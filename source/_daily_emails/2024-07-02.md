  Continuous integration is not the same as a CI pipeline.

Yesterday I replied to [a post on X](https://x.com/ianmiell/status/1304103008242991111):

[I've written about this before][0] and I think the term CI or CI/CD is one of the most misused or misleading in software development.

CI, or continuous integration, is, as the post days, the process of everyone merging their changes at least once, or usually several, times a day.

It isn't something that is configured or created - it's a process.

## Here's the thing

You can do CI without a CI pipeline and vice versa.

You can have a CI pipeline but not do continuous delivery or deployment.

What most people think of as CI or CI/CD is a set of automated checks that run when code is updated - usually on a feature or topic branch.

Whilst important, it's not "CI".
