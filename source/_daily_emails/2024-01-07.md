  How long _should_ a software development task take to complete?

Today, I saw a post that asked the question:

> Have you ever spent three days on an issue that should have taken 2 hours?

My thought was, "Who said it should have taken two hours?".

In my experience, tasks take as long as they take.

Even something that seems simple can end up being something complex.
