    Do you want free code reviews? What about contributing to open-source?
---

Do you want to contribute to open-source software, such as Drupal core or one of the thousands of modules or themes?

Are you worried about receiving negative comments or feedback?

Instead, think of it as free code reviews.

Contributing to open-source is a great way to gain experience and learn from other Developers, and something that I still do often, 17 years after starting to develop software.

I'm also happy to review people's open-source for free. If that would be of interest, reply and let me know.
