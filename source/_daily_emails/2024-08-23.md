This week, I'm speaking at the newly-restarted PHP Berkshire meetup.

Organised by Humand Talent, the same people who now organise PHP Oxford (where I spoke in January), this time I'm [speaking about Sculpin][0] - the PHP static site generator I use for my website and to publish my [new Zettlekasten notes][1].

I'm looking forward to discussing again why I like static site generators and what benefits they offer.

I have some things I want to make sure I mention, so expect a note in my Zettlekasten about that soon, too.

If you're interested, [here's the demo website][2] I did for PHP South West, [along with the code on GitHub][3].
