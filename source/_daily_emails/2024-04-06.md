    Drupal isn't just a content management system. It's a content management framework.

There used to be a saying:

If you want to build a website, use <enter CMS name here>. If you want to build <CMS name>, use Drupal.

I think I've heard it used with all the other content management systems, and it isn't about saying one is better.

It highlights that Drupal isn't just a content management system - it's a content management framework.

A framework you use to build your content management system to meet your needs.

Straight away after installing Drupal, you can create as many content types as you want with as many fields as you want to build as simple or complex a content model as you need.

You aren't restricted to the default page and article content types or a fixed set of fields.

That, along with Views - a built-in query builder to build pages and blocks of your content, user login and registration, and JSON:API to allow other applications, such as mobile apps, to access your data, to name a few things, makes Drupal a very powerful option.
