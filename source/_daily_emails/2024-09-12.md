  When did you last deploy a change to production?

If you've experienced issues or are worried about deploying changes to production, on a Friday or another day, when did you last deploy something?

Can you make deployments smaller and more frequent?

Deploying regularly makes each deployment less risky and having a smaller changeset makes it easier to find and fix any issues that arise.

I'm much happier deploying to production if I've already done so that day, or at least that week.

Any time more than that, or if the changeset is large, the more likely there will be issues and the longer it will take to resolve them.
