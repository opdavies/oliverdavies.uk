    This is my 600th daily email!
---

This is the 600th daily email I've sent to this list, containing my software developments thoughts, tips and updates.

I'd like to thank all of the subscribers to the email list, including those who send me replies with their thoughts and opinions on what I write.

It's been great to speak to subscribers at in-person events and conferences too, and to hear how some of my thoughts and approaches have helped others.

I want to continue growing the email list and the community of subscribers, so please forward any emails that you find useful or insightful, or share them on social media so others can find them, and I'll look forward to getting to 1,000 emails and beyond.
