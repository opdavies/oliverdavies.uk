    I'm started writing a Zettelkasten and I'll be publishing it online.
---

Inspired by others like rwxrob and Mischa van den Burg, I've started experimenting with the Zettelkasten method of atomic note-taking alongside my current methods.

Originally writing notes as text files in Vim, I've decided to [start publishing them online][0], where possible. The first notes are already there.

This will be separate to this email list and will contain notes on various topics, not just programming and software development, although I can imagine some notes progressing to be part of emails sent to this list.

The website itself is open-source and [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/opdavies/zet.oliverdavies.uk), and each page has an "Improve this page" link to edit that page and submit a pull request on GitHub.

The website is a basic [Sculpin static site][1] with a notes content type.

There is no styling yet, as I wanted to focus on deploying the MVP version, but I will add some styling and some additional features in the future.

At the moment, I'm focusing on writing as often as possible for this email list and in my new Zettelkasten.
