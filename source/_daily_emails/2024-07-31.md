  Why I use Linux for my operating system.
---

A common reason when speaking with Developers who use Linux as their operating system is that their software will run on Linux in production, so it's best to run it on Linux locally.

For me, it's more to do with what software I'm using instead of where it's hosted.

I develop using open-source software - Git, PHP, Drupal, Sculpin, Vue.js, Ansible, Nix, Tailwind CSS, Neovim - just to name a few, as well as maintaining my own open-source projects.

It aligns with my ethos and ethics that my operating system and the applications I use are open-source too, when possible.

I use NixOS as my operating system.

I develop in Alacritty, tmux and Neovim, and use open-source tools and language servers when coding.

I edit podcasts and videos in Kdenlive, and create thumbnails in GIMP.

I don't use exclusively open-source tools, but that's my preference.

I'm also not locked in to one hardware supplier or one way of doing something.

If I want to change to a different window manager or from stable to rolling releases, I can.

I can make my tools work for me instead of adapting my workflow around them.
