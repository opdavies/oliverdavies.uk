I'm happy to be speaking at DrupalCamp Belgium next month, on the 10th and 11th of May in Ghent.

I'll be presenting two sessions on [automated testing in Drupal][testing] (Friday) and [Tailwind CSS][tailwind] (Saturday).

I spoke about testing most recently at DrupalCon Lille, and I'm looking forward to updating my Tailwind talk again to include the latest features within the framework.

[Tickets are still available][tickets] and it would be great to see you there.
