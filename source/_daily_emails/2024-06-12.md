  Do you record architectural and technological decisions made on your projects?
---

I recently [saw this post on X][0], talking about an open-source project.

This was the part that I want to highlight:

> I was also impressed by the decisions documents. More projects should implement this concept.

Looking at the repository, it contains records of 36 decisions made on the project between May 2023 and April 2024.

Decision records provide useful information to new people to a project, whether you want to contribute to an open-source project or it's a new client or work codebase.

The code and project will likely continue once you've finished working on it, so capturing decisions for future Developers is key.

I've often joined projects and wondered why or how something was done, and can only guess as the decision wasn't recorded or is somewhere not available to me, such as an old wiki or ticketing system.

## Here's the thing

I agree with the poster.

More people should record the decisions made on their project, whether it's open-source or not.
