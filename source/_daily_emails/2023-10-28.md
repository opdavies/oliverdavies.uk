If you don't write automated tests or do test-driven development, you might move quickly to begin with - writing code and doing small amounts of manual testing.

But, once you start changing the code to add new features or fix bugs, things will begin to slow down.

You'll have more to test and need to ensure you don't break the existing functionality as well as your new code works.

Whilst it may be faster initially, skipping tests will cause problems later.
