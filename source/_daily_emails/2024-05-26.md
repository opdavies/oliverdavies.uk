  Is it time to stop writing stylesheets is Sass?
---

I've seen a lot of recent posts that ask questions like "Is it time to stop writing Sass?".

I haven't written a Less or Sass stylesheet since I adopted utility classes and Tachyons, and then Tailwind CSS, and I moved to PostCSS.

But, with recent native browser support added for some Sass features, such as [CSS nesting][nesting] and [CSS custom properties][custom properties] (variables), people are considering moving from Sass to regular CSS.

Using regular CSS also makes it easier to onboard new Developers onto your project, which is particularly helpful in open-source projects, as [Mark Conroy and I discussed][podcast] on the Beyond Blocks podcast.
