Today, Drupal 10 was released alongside Drupal 9.5.

This means that, as of today, Drupal 9.3 is no longer supported, so people should update to 9.4, 9.5, or 10.

As things stand, Drupal 7 is still supported until November 2023.

I haven't tried upgrading any existing websites from Drupal 9 to 10 yet, but I have already started a new client project with Drupal 10.

It's a project for a new client that we've been discussing for a few months, and we wanted to wait until Drupal 10 was released before starting. My preparation work has been on the release candidate version of Drupal 10, so I can't foresee any issues updating to the stable 10.0.0 version.

As an open-source Drupal project maintainer, I'll soon release Drupal 10 compatible versions of my maintained modules and themes, such as Override Node Options and the Tailwind CSS starter kit theme.

If your company has a Drupal module that needs to be upgraded to be Drupal 10 compatible, or needs a module to integrate your service with Drupal 10, reply to this email and let's arrange a call and see if we can work together.
