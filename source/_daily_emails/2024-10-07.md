In the most recent episode of the Beyond Blocks podcast, I spoke with Jürgen Haas about Drupal's ECA module.

ECA stands for Events, Conditions and Actions and is a module I was aware of, but haven't used before - so I was great to learn more about it.

I also got to meet Jürgen at DrupalCon in Barcelona, as well as several other podcast guests, which was fantastic.
