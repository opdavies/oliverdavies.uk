Although I wouldn't consider myself a "Laravel Developer", I enjoy watching the talks from the Laravel conferences, most recently Laracon US, that took place last week.

I like to learn from other communities and adopt relevant practices or tools within my projects. I did this with Laravel Collections, which I use on nearly every project.

## Laravel Prompts

I watched Jess Archer's talk on the new Laravel Prompts and was happy when she said it worked with plain PHP projects, not just Laravel.

This means I can potentially use it with Drupal and Drush or Symfony Console applications, too, such as my build configuration file generator.

## Here's the thing

I like tools I can use across multiple technologies and prefer framework-agnostic tools to specific ones.

Then, if I'm working on a different project, I can use the tools I already know instead of learning something different just for that.
