    A new version of Drupal is only a single command away.

Now [Drupal 10.3 has been released][0], and [websites need to be updated to 10.3 before Drupal 11][1], it's time to start updating your Drupal 10 websites.

Luckily, with Composer, upgrading is one simple command.

There's no need to download .tar.gz or .zip files or update version numbers in a Drush Make file any more.

If you want to update everything, a simple `composer update` will do.

If you want to only update Drupal core, then you'll need to run something like `composer update drupal/core` or `composer update drupal/core-*`, or something slightly different if you're using a distribution like Commerce Kickstart or LocalGov Drupal.

I think adopting Composer was one of the best decisions the Drupal project made - not only [to include third-party code][2], such as Symfony components, but it also makes applications so much easier to update.
