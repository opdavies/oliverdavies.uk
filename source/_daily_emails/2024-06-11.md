  Do you separate your logic into different categories?
---

I recently watched [a video about separating logic][0] into different categories within your custom code.

It wasn't a PHP video, but the concept applies to any programming language or framework.

This was the final structure of the directories:

```plain
src/
  Controllers/
  Domain/
  Persistence/
  Properties/
  Services/
```

It was described as using `Controllers` for presentational logic, `Domain` for domain logic, and `Services` for application logic, and reminds me of a domain-driven design (DDD) approach to organising code.

I remember watching other older videos showing separating business and presentational logic in React into different components (if I remember correctly).

This isn't an approach I see in Drupal code, maybe more-so in other PHP framework-based projects like Symfony or Laravel.

It's something I've been thinking of trying, potentially on my website codebase.

Do you organise your code in this or a similar way?

If so, why?

What advantages does it bring?
