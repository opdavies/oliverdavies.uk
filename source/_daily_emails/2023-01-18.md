On Sunday, the Drupal project turned 22 years old.

I've personally been working with Drupal primarily for almost 15 years [according to my Drupal.org profile](https://www.drupal.org/u/opdavies), self teaching and working on personal and freelance projects since 2007, and in full-time roles since 2010 when I started at Horse and Country TV to work on their Drupal 6 website.

Last month, I started my first Drupal 10 project for a client.

I'm proud that over a year of that time was spent working for the Drupal Association where I improved the Drupal.org websites and resolved issues that would have blocked the Drupal 8 release in 2015.

I'm also happy to have [presented talks and workshops](https://www.oliverdavies.uk/talks) at events like DrupalCamps, Drupal Developer Days and twice at DrupalCon. I've also organised Drupal events such as the Drupal Bristol meetup and DrupalCamp Bristol conference.

I've had opportunities to contribute to open-source by having patches committed to Drupal core and maintaining modules and themes like [Override Node Options](https://www.drupal.org/project/override_node_options) and the [Tailwind CSS starter kit](https://www.drupal.org/project/tailwindcss). I've also mentored and helped others to get their first commits to Drupal core and open-source.

I plan to continue working with Drupal and being part of the community for a long time, hopefully for at least another 22 years.
