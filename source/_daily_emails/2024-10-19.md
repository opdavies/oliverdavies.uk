  PHPUnit or Pest? Which do you prefer?
---

This is a common question from people starting to write automated tests in PHP:

> Should I use PHPUnit or Pest PHP?

I've used both.

They both have pros and cons.

If you're familiar with JavaScript and Jest, Pest would probably be a natural fit.

If you're used to writing classes in PHP, PHPUnit may feel more familiar.

Use whichever appeals to you.

Maybe try both and see which you prefer.

The main benefit will be you have tests, whichever you decide to use.
