Many projects I’ve worked on in the past haven’t had an automated test suite.

If you don't or can't write tests for your project for some reason, I'd love it if you could reply to this email or [let me know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/opdavies) and let me know why.

I know some of the classic reasons, like "I don't have time" and "My clients won't pay for me to write them", but I'd like to get some more real-world examples.

Then I'll do some follow-up posts to look into and address them.
