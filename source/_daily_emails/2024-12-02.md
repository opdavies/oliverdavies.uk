Last week, I released a new version of the [Override Node Options module][0] - version 8.x-2.9.

This version makes the module compatible with Drupal 11 and, as there are no breaking changes, it's still compatible with Drupal 9 and 10.

It's great to see the module used on many Drupal 8+ websites and distributions such as [LocalGov Drupal][1].

Whilst [the overall number of installations has been consistent][2], the number of Drupal 7 installations has decreased whilst the Drupal 8+ version installations have increased.

With a Drupal 11-compatible version now available, I hope it continues to increase.
