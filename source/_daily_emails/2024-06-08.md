  Drupal is older than...
---

Whilst writing [yesterday's email][yesterday] about "not invented here", I started thinking about how Drupal's timeline (which was created 23 years ago) compares to some of the other similar or related projects.

Here's a list of project release dates from ChatGPT, which seem correct to me at a glance:

- Drupal: January 15, 2001.
- Git: April 7, 2005.
- Symfony 1: October 22, 2005.
- GitHub and Bitbucket: 2008.
- GitLab: October 2011.
- Laravel: June 9, 2011.
- Drupal 7: January 5, 2011.
- Symfony 2: July 28, 2011.
- Composer: March 1, 2012.
- Drupal 8: November 19, 2015.

Looking at this list, when speaking about "not invented here", a lot of what Drupal would come to use and depend on just didn't exist in its early years.
