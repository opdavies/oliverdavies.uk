  I've used Drush for as long as I've used Drupal, so why isn't it included by default?

I've used Drush - the Drupal shell - to interact with my Drupal applications on the command line since I started around 2008.

It's always been part of my Drush experience.

From installing Drupal and performing routine actions such as enabling modules and clearing caches to, in newer Drupal versions, performing migrations and generating Storybook stories.

Many projects I work on have custom Drush commands to perform tasks from the command line.

This week, I created a new Drupal 11 project for a client using the [drupal/core-recommended][0] package and initially forgot to install Drush so I could install Drupal.

I'm surprised Drush isn't in Drupal core or a dependency of the recommended package.

There is a basic Drupal CLI at [core/scripts/drupal][1], but I wonder if we'll see a fully-featured CLI tool like Drush included with Drupal core, similar to Symfony's console or Laravel's artisan commands.

For me, including Drush would be an obvious choice.
