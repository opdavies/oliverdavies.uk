Everyone tests their code.

No one writes code and ships it to production before testing it works.

It's just that most Developers test their code manually.

They write the code, switch to a browser or terminal, and run it.

It might be a quick task, such as reloading a page or executing a command, or it could be complex and time-consuming, such as filling in a long form and checking the results.

In this case, automated testing is a good option.

Instead of filling in the form, have the tests do it for you.

It will be quicker and more reliable than doing it manually.
