The value in a CI pipeline is when its commands and checks are running successfully, and the pipeline is passing.

And then keeping it passing.

If the pipeline fails, it loses all of its value.

Passing should be its default state, and effort should be made to ensure it continues to pass.

If a pipeline fails, the change is not deployed, and the failure should be investigated and rectified so the pipeline is returned to a passing state and providing value.
