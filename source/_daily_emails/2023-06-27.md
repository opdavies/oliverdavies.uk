Imagine having a team member who tests each feature before every deployment, reviews the code to ensure its style is consistent, runs quality checks like linting and static analysis, and checks for insecure dependencies.

If those checks all pass, they automatically deploy the changes and make them live or update a pre-production environment.

## Here's the thing

A CI pipeline can do that. Automatically. For every commit and change to your codebase.

Having a CI pipeline is like having an additional team member and one who's always ready and waiting for someone to push a change to test.
