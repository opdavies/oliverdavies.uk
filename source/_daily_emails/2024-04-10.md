    Resurrecting the Speakerdeck Field Drupal module
---

This week, I've resurrected the [Speakerdeck field Drupal module][module].

It's a module I wrote in 2017 for the Drupal 8 version of my website to embed Speakerdeck slides on my talk pages.

My website now runs on Drupal 10, but the great thing is that the same code that worked for Drupal 8 also works for Drupal 9 and 10.

There was no rewrite for each major version, and as I'm not using any deprecated code, the same code works for all the modern versions mentioned, and it looks like it will for Drupal 11, too.
