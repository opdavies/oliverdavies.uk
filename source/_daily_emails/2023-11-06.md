For my first time in the podcast host chair, I interviewed Matt Glaman - Principal Software Engineer at Acquia.

I initially knew Matt from his work on Drupal Commerce, but I wanted to learn about his new project, Retrofit - a tool to make it easier to upgrade from Drupal 7 (which will be end of life in January 2025) to Drupal 10.

We also talked briefly about PHPStan Drupal and drupal-check, which are some of Matt's other projects and contributions to the Drupal community.

Thank you, Matt, for being the first guest on the Beyond Blocks podcast.

I have other guests booked for this week, so the episode with Matt will be [published soon][podcast].
