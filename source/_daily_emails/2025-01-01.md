  Happy New Year, everyone!
---

I can't believe it's 2025!

It's going to be a busy year with Drupal's 23rd birthday, Drupal 7's end-of-life date and the release of Drupal CMS all happening in January!

There's the inaugural DrupalCamp England in Cambridge in March that I'm planning to attend, and the Global Contribution Day event in London (and everywhere else).

I'm looking forward to the upcoming episodes of [the Beyond Blocks podcast][0] and finding time for more open source contributions and [coding live streams][1] again.

This is daily email #714, which means I'll get to 1,000 emails in October - which will be a huge milestone!

Of course, I want to continue growing my email list, podcast listeners and YouTube followers, so if anything is interesting to you, please share it with anyone else you think would benefit from it.
