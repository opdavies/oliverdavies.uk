This week, I reviewed a client's Drupal 9 website and investigated the steps needed to upgrade to Drupal 10.

Looking at the Git log to see the commits for a module, I see `Week 20 development` as the latest commit message.

That commit changed 106 files, added 3,453 lines and removed 17 lines, including custom module and theme changes, contrib module updates and library updates.

This should have been several commits, each performing a clear and separate task.

Updating the dependencies should be its own commit, and changes to the custom modules and theme should be separate commits.

Then each commit could have its own clear and descriptive commit message explaining why each change was needed, any issues that were encountered during the change, and any alternative approaches considered.

That would have been more useful for me whilst looking through the logs than `Week 20 development`.
