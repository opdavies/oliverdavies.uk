  Here's an interesting thing I spotted about the usage statistics for the Override Node Options Drupal module...

Before [my remote talk for the Drupal London meetup][0], I'm updating the usage statistics for [the Override Node Options module][1] - one of the modules I maintain on Drupal.org.

In my slides for DrupalCamp Belgium, I showed the usage figures from October 2023, which showed 38,096 installations and it being the 173rd most installed module.

This week, the number of installations has slightly increased to 38,223.

What's interesting is that whilst the number of installations has been consistent, there are a lot less Drupal 7 websites using the module and a lot more Drupal 8+ sites using it.

## October 2023

- 5.x-1.x: 1
- 6.x-1.x: 297
- 7.x-1.x: 13,717
- 8.x-2.x: 24,081
- Total: 38,096

## November 2024

- 5.x-1.x: 4
- 6.x-1.x: 202
- 7.x-1.x: 10,429
- 8.x-2.x: 27,588
- Total: 38,223

Assuming these numbers are correct, this makes me feel very positive and happy about the adoption of newer versions of Drupal and that people are upgrading their D7 websites to Drupal 10 or 11.
