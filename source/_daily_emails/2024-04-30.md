  This week, I've set up Xdebug on a new project to help with some complicated debugging.
---

In PHP, we have functions like `var_dump()`, `dump()` and `dd()` that are used to debug code and print output to the screen.

In Drupal, we have functions like `dpm()` and `kint()`, too.

These functions are great for simple debugging but sometimes I need more, which is when I reach for a step debugger - namely, Xdebug.

This is common when working in complex legacy code, where you need to be able to see a breakpoint and step through the code to see what path it takes and what the state is at each step.

## Enter Xdebug

Xdebug is a tool I use fairly often and something I have configured on an individual project basis.

This week, I spent some time adding it to a new project and ensured my notes and documentation still worked.

I use Docker and Docker Compose on Linux, so there are slight changes compared to running PHP natively, so I wanted to make sure it still works.

I've added my latest setup to my [Drupal Docker Example repository][repo] and plan to add it to my standard [Build Configs] setup for Drupal projects.

If you use Docker Compose on Linux, it may be useful for you.

If you haven't tried Xdebug before, I suggest giving it a try and see if improves your debugging.
