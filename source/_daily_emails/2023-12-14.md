Drupal distributions are pre-built versions of Drupal for specific use cases.

Need an eCommerce store? Use Commerce Kickstart.

Are you a local council looking for a new website? Look at LocalGov Drupal.

Contenta CMS is an API-first Drupal distribution for headless and decoupled content.

There are numerous others - each containing a list of pre-installed and configured modules to give you more functionality out of the box.

If you're starting a new project, try starting with an appropriate distribution instead of starting from scratch with a standard installation of Drupal core and save yourself time and effort.
