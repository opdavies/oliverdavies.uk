  Do you use the "drush deploy" command? I found out about it this week and will be refactoring some deployment pipelines to use it.

This week I learned about the [drush deploy command][0].

It's been available since Drush 10.3 and combines several commands together in an attempt to "standardise how Drupal deployments work".

These commands are:

```shell
drush updatedb
drush config:import
drush cache:rebuild
drush deploy:hook
```

Usually, I run these commands separately but grouping them and standardising makes a lot of sense.

`drush deploy:hook` is also very interesting and allows for adding deploy hooks similar to update hooks in .install files.

I'm looking forward to updating my deployment pipelines to use this and making them simpler and easier to maintain.
