  Why is everyone moving to SQLite?
---

I've noticed a lot of Developers recently adopting SQLite for their database and I wonder why this is.

Laravel changed their default database to SQLite for local development.

It simplifies the development environment as there's no need for a separate database like MySQL or MariaDB but, if you'll be using one of those in production, won't that cause more issues when you migrate your local application?

Drupal supports using SQLite, but, other than for [my automated testing course][course], or when running automated tests, I've always used a MySQL or MariaDB database.

Maybe this is something to keep an eye on and potentially use more for some scenarios in the future.
