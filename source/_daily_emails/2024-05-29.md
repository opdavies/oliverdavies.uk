What can you do to make your current task easier to achieve?

Can you refactor the existing code to make it easier to change?

Are there requirements that are no longer needed and can be de-scoped to make the code simpler or smaller?

Is there a more minimum-viable version that you can release now and iterate on it later?

Is there an existing solution, such as a library, module or plugin you can use instead of implementing it yourself?

Is there a different or simpler implementation that satisfies most of the requirements that you can use?

Taking an easier option means less code to maintain and a more stable application.
