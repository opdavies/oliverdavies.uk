    A few months ago, I started re-learning Behat whilst live streaming.
---

A few months ago, I started doing some [live coding sessions on YouTube][0] again.

As well as [writing automated tests for the Content Access by Path module][1], I [started to re-learn Behat][2] - a behavioural testing tool for PHP.

I've used Behat before but mainly use PHPUnit in Drupal to write my automated tests, so I thought I'd try it again in my [Build Configs][3] tool written in Symfony.

In that stream, I was able to install it, do some research to refresh my memory, and get some initial tests running.

I've been busy finishing some client development projects recently (and still have some availability for Q3 projects), but I will pick up the live streaming again soon!
