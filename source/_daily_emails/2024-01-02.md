Doing pair or programming doesn't mean you need to be working in groups continuously.

If you've asked a colleague to review the code you're writing or help you fix a bug, that's pair programming.

You don't always need a driver and navigator, a set rotation time or dedicated allocated daily pair programming time.

While that works for some teams, and on some occasions, you can do what's needed or feels right at the time to complete the task at hand.

If you need a short pair programming session to fix a bug or finish a feature, to review some code before you merge it or submit it for code review, or want to pair ad-hoc or for one afternoon a week, that works, too.

There isn't one way to do pair or mob programming.

Do what works for you.
