CSS usually has a global scope which can make change risky.

How do you know that changing CSS in a global stylesheet to fix a bug won't cause more elsewhere?

Tailwind CSS and utility classes change CSS to a local scope.

You can see what styling is applied to an element by looking at its classes and easily make changes without worrying that it will cause unexpected issues elsewhere.
