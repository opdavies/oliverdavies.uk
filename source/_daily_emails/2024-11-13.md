Next Wednesday evening, I'm going to be speaking remotely at the Drupal London meetup.

I was originally going to attend in person, but after injuring my foot last week, I can't travel so will have to join remotely.

I'm going to be giving a talk and demo of [automated testing and test-driven development with Drupal][0] as well as some Q&A and pair programming, if time allows and we're able to do so remotely.

RSVPs are still open for the event and hopefully I'll get to attend Drupal London in person in the future.
