In PHPUnit, there are different ways to write test methods.

The standard way is to use camel-case method names with a `test` prefix, for example:

```php
public function testTheProjectNameShouldBeAString(): void
{
    // ...
}
```

Another popular way, particularly in some frameworks, is to use snake-case method names:

```php
/** @test */
public function the_project_name_should_be_a_string(): void
{
    // ...
}
```

This may be more readable but only works if the `@test` annotation is present.

What if you need to add another annotation, such as `@dataProvider` to the test? Do you do multi-line docblocks everywhere, or mix and match single and multiple line docblocks depending on the test?

## Here's the thing

My preference switches between both ways of writing test methods.

But, whichever way I write it, I write descriptive method names that explain what the test does - even if it means having a long method name.

I avoid short and generic names like `testUpdate()`.

People should be able to read the test name and understand what it does and what it's testing.
