Previously when I gave my [Taking Flight with Tailwind CSS]({{site.url}}/presentations/taking-flight-with-tailwind-css) talk, I created examples that relate to the event such as something related to that technology or event.

The nor(DEV):con website already uses Tailwind CSS so I've been looking for other examples and have started to build some of the [Bootstrap CSS components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples) with Tailwind CSS.

I've created the [Album](http://bootstrap-with-tailwind.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/album) and [Pricing](http://bootstrap-with-tailwind.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pricing) components so far but will likely do more before the conference as I think they're good examples.

[The source code](https://github.com/opdavies/bootstrap-with-tailwind) is on my GitHub profile, uses Astro and its Tailwind CSS integration, the default Tailwind configuration with some slight colour and font tweaks, the official Typography plugin and a small custom plugin that adds a "hocus" variant for both hover and focus styles.
