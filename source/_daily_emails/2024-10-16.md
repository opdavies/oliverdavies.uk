  Oliver and Chris Ballard discuss generative AI in PHP.
---

In this week's episode of the [Beyond Blocks podcast][0], I'm joined by Chris Ballard to discuss generative AI in PHP following his talk at PHP South West.

We also talked about attending and speaking at meetups and live coding, and I spoke about some of the AI-related content I saw presented at DrupalCon Barcelona.

[Listen to the episode now][1].
