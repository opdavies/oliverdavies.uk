  My homelab laptop is running a combination of native NixOS services and some running with Docker and Docker Compose.

As I've added software to my NixOS homelab server, I've found some things that aren't yet available in the nixpkgs repository.

A common approach seems to be to use Docker and Docker Compose to run things in containers, especially ones that need multiple services like a web server, a database and a cache or proxy.

[I've moved my development projects from Docker to devenv][1], but I still have Docker installed and available.

I knew it was easy to create a container image from a Nix-based setup, but the opposite is also true.

It's very easy to run containers within NixOS.

For example, here's [how I've configured Tube Archivist][0].

This was created using a tool called `compose2nix`, but I've seen simpler examples for other services.

This made it easy to take a Docker Compose file and convert it to a Docker or Podman container.

My preference is to use NixOS services if they exist, but it's great to be able to do this as an alternative when needed.
