  Here's an example of how I'm running Drupal applications locally with Nix and devenv.
---

I recently said that [I've been using devenv to run Drupal applications locally][0].

Here's the `devenv.nix` file I used for [my recent talk for the Drupal London meetup][1]:

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

let
  drupal.root = "web";
in
{
  packages = [ pkgs.git ];

  dotenv.disableHint = true;

  languages = {
    php = {
      enable = true;
      version = "8.2";

      ini = ''
        memory_limit = 256M
      '';

      fpm.pools.web = {
        listen = "127.0.0.1:9000";

        settings = {
          "pm" = "dynamic";
          "pm.max_children" = 75;
          "pm.max_requests" = 500;
          "pm.max_spare_servers" = 20;
          "pm.min_spare_servers" = 5;
          "pm.start_servers" = 10;
        };
      };
    };
  };

  processes = { };

  services = {
    caddy = {
      enable = true;

      config = ''
        {
          http_port 8080
        }

        localhost:8080 {
          root * ${drupal.root}
          encode gzip
          php_fastcgi localhost:9000
          file_server
        }
      '';
    };

    mysql = {
      enable = true;
      initialDatabases = [ { name = "drupal_london"; } ];
    };
  };

  enterShell = ''
    if [[ ! -d vendor ]]; then
      composer install
    fi
  '';

  enterTest = ''
    phpunit --testdox
  '';
}
```

It installs the required version of PHP for this project, creates a web server (Caddy) and configures MariaDB with a default database.

I've also added commands to run `composer install` to download dependencies when entering the shell and `phpunit` for tests.

With this approach, there's no need for containers as everything is run locally and I can view the site at <http://localhost:8080> (or whatever port is defined).

All of my current development projects are using this approach and I think it'll be my default method for future projects.
