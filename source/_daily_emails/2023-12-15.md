On several occasions, I've seen companies who build a lot of Drupal projects creating their own in-house [Drupal distribution] for new projects.

Whilst this seems like a good idea, the ones I've seen are either not well maintained due to limited time between projects, or they're bloated with features and trying to include too much out of the box.

If you maintain an in-house distribution, or are thinking of creating one, my advice is to ensure it's maintained by allocating enough time for this, and to keep it lean and only include the minimum amount of required functionality.

Alternatively, maybe keep a template composer.json file to base new projects on instead of a full distribution.

That could declare the modules and themes you want to include, without the additional overhead.
