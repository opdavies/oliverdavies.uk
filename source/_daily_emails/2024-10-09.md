  Is AI a good pair-programming partner?
---

Instead of [using AI to autocomplete code][0] or [perform tasks within your Drupal website][1], I've seen people using AI as a virtual pair programming partner.

Similar to using a search engine or finding results on websites like Stack Overflow, but also being able to ask follow-up questions and for clarification as part of a conversation.

You're still relying on its answers and advice to be correct, but using AI as a learning tool seems like a sensible approach if you don't have a non-AI pairing partner available.

Just make sure to validate and verify whatever it gives you.

Once you've committed it, you're responsible for it.
