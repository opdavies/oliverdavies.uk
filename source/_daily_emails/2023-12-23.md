[In yesterday's email][yesterday], I mentioned using several programming languages and frameworks.

Drupal is my main specialism and the one I have the most experience and knowledge of, but you don't need to use only Drupal code.

Using Composer, you can add parts of other frameworks to other projects.

I don't use Laravel often as a full-stack framework, but I use the Collections library, and recently the Pipelines library, in almost every project - whether it's Drupal or Symfony, it can be added to any PHP project.

Start small, keep things simple, and add what you need.

You don't need to go all in on one option, you can pick the pieces you like and that work for you.
