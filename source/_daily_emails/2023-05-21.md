With the focus being on Drupal 7's potential end-of-life this November, it's also worth being aware that Drupal 9 (released in June 2020) will also be unsupported as of November 2023.

This is because of its dependency on Symfony 4, which is ending its security support in November.

Drupal 10 was released in December 2022 and will be the main version until Drupal 11 is released in 2024.

Luckily, major upgrades of Drupal are much easier these days, with no large code rewrite or data migration required.
