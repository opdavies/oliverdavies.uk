Today, Beyond Blocks - [the podcast I started last year][0] and has 20 published episodes - passed 1,000 total downloads.

I've had some great guests on the show and discussed some interesting topics so far and I have others recorded and guests lined up for future episodes.

This week's episode will be with Eirik Morland again - the first returning guest - where we discuss the improvements and changes that have been made to Violinist.io since we spoke in January.

[The first episode with Erik is here][1] if you want to listen to it beforehand.

Thanks to all the guests and listeners of the podcast, and if you'd like to be a guest or suggest a topic, reply and let me know.
