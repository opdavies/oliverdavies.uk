  Is embedding AI in Drupal a good thing?
---

I saw a lot of AI-related content at DrupalCon, including the Driesnote and the Track Lead keynote.

The Driesnote showed a demonstration of Drupal CMS (aka Starshot), which included an AI chatbot that performed tasks such as renaming content types and building views.

I also remember seeing AI populating alt text for images in one of the sessions.

I'm still on the fence about AI and when and how it should be used.

[My experiences of using AI so far haven't been great][0], but I have seen some interesting implementation and use-cases for it.

I'm seeing AI being added everywhere - from my search results to suggesting social media comments and generating notes and issues within services I use.

I can see how a AI-driven approach to site building in Drupal could be useful, but I'm still unsure.

What do you think?
