  For some things, I use watch commands. For others, I have integrations in ny text editor.

[In yesterday's email][yesterday], I mentioned that I use watch commands such as `nodemon`, `watchexec` and `entr` whilst developing to run commands automatically when I change code.

For example, running `find web/modules/custom | entr ./run test` will re-run my test suite when any custom module changes.

This works well for tests, but for other checks, such as static analysis with PHPStan or coding standards with PHPCS, I have integrations in Neovim, and I get real-time feedback as I code.

If a line fails static analysis or coding standards, a diagnostic message is shown so I can fix it immediately, and I don't need to use a watcher or wait for my CI pipeline to fail.
