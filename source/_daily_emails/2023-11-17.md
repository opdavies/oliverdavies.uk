[This week's episode][episode] of the Beyond Blocks podcast is live, where I speak with Panagiotis Moutsopoulos (vensires on Drupal.org) - Drupal Backend Developer at E-Sepia.

We discuss his first time DrupalCon and, more specifically, his session "Drupal's Alternate Realities" - a "Birds of a Feather" (BoF) session presenting some history, but mainly the different ways to tackle a problem in Drupal using different methodologies.
