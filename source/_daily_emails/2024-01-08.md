  Have you tried new technologies or approaches when writing software? Did you like it or go back? Either way, you know more about it than before.

I recently saw a post with a screenshot of some code they'd written using Tailwind CSS.

Reading the comments, it had the usual "re-inventing the wheel" and "just use inline styles" comments, which, to me, didn't seem very helpful and not the point of the post.

When I've given a [talk on Tailwind CSS][talk], I've acknowledged that people have common initial reactions and suggested people try it for a week or so and see how it works for them before making up their minds.

Someone did after a conference and posted this on Twitter:

> I saw a talk on tailwind at a conference. Spent 15 minutes afterwards "discussing" with the presenter how it was horrible and against the neat way of CSS and so on. But promised to try it just once as he said it feels better than it looks.

> He was right. It's so freeing.

The same approach applies to many other things, such as pair programming, automated testing, test-driven development, static analysis, Scrum, Linux and Vim - to name a few.

If you use it and don't like it, don't continue and return to what you did before.

Whether you keep it or not, you better understand what you're evaluating and not dismiss it out of hand.
