  It's not just me who writes their notes in plain text files. Here are some others who I found recently.
---

After writing about [using text files for my personal wiki][0], I've found others who do the same.

- Derek Sivers wrote a blog post about [why he uses text files][5].
- Ricky Kresslein read Derek's blog post and migrated his notes, [wrote a blog post][3] and recorded a video.
- Sebastian Daschner recorded a video about [a simple knowledge system][4] using plain-text files and asciidoc.
- Nick Janetakis, a former guest [on the Beyond Blocks podcast][1], wrote a small Bash script to maintain his plain text files, which I've [added to my NixOS configuration][2].

Do you know anyone else who uses plain text files for their notes?

If you don't, I'd recommend it.
