Surprisingly, it's been two and a half years since I last did a live coding stream.

As well as talk recordings and demos, I did a few live streams back then, working on the "Test-Driven Drupal" project and submitting a merge request to Drupal core.

It's been something that I'd like to get back into and pick up again, and I plan on doing that within the next few weeks.

I have a new freelance project due to start in December but getting back into streaming seems like a good way to make sure that I put aside time for open-source and side projects, as well as for writing longer form blog posts and hopefully starting to prepare more meetup and conference talks again.

I'll be streaming again on my YouTube channel, so if you'd like to be notified when I do, [please subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkeK0qF9HHUPQH_fvn4ghqQ?sub_confirmation=1).
