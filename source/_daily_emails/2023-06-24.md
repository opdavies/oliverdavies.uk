While writing yesterday's email, I saw this on my Drupal.org profile (https://www.drupal.org/u/opdavies):

> Credited on 200 fixed issues

This is not the number of commits I've made to projects and doesn't include issues on other websites like GitHub, but that I've been tagged as a contributor in 200 fixed issues on Drupal.org - aka "contribution credits".

It includes issues for projects I maintain, like Override Node Options and the Tailwind CSS starter kit, as well as contributions for events I've spoken at, like DrupalCon Europe and BADCamp, and modules for Drupal.org itself that I worked on whilst at the Drupal Association.

It also includes contrib projects others maintain, such as the Feature Toggle module and Drupal Commerce, and distributions like Commerce Kickstart and Open Atrium.

In particular, I'm proud of the 17 issues for Drupal core - some for patches I've contributed, some I've reviewed, and some whilst I've mentored at events like DrupalCons and DrupalCamps.

I've been allocating more open-source time recently, so expect the number of contributions on Drupal.org and GitHub to continue.
