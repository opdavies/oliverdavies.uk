This week on the [Beyond Blocks podcast][podcast], I'm joined by Dan Leech - a PHP Developer and open-source project creator.

He and I recently gave talks at the PHP South West meetup, where Dan introduced a new project - PHP-TUI - for building terminal user interfaces (TUIs) with PHP.

I use one of Dan's other open-source projects - Phpactor - within Neovim, and he also presented at PHP South Wales about PHPBench, so it was great to discuss and learn more about these in this episode.

[Listen to the episode now][episode], and I'll be back with more in the New Year.
