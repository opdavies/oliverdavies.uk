    Tailwind CSS v4 is coming soon, with even more CSS.
---

As someone [who has been using Tailwind CSS][0] since before 1.0, I'm looking forward to the next major version - Tailwind CSS v4.

A main difference compared to previous versions is that it will be configured in CSS using CSS variables (aka custom properties).

No more `tailwind.config.js` configuration files, just variables like `--color-blue-100`.

As I [already use CSS variables in some situations][1], I like that it will make it easier to re-use them within Tailwind and give a more consistent experience.

As well as simple variables, such as colours and spacing, I'm interested to see how everything else will translate to the new configuration approach in Tailwind v4, as well as anything else new that will be included.
