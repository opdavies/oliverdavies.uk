  Have you over been too proud to ask a question, even if it affects your productivity?

Today, I was reading a support request on a public forum.

The poster asked a question about a technical issue and explained the problem they were experiencing. I was experiencing the same thing, which is how I found it.

A community member responded and suggested a solution.

To this, the original poster responded:

> Not too proud to ask where I [make the change].

The response to this was what caught my attention:

> No problem. Don't let pride get in the way of productivity.

## Here's the thing

Don't be afraid to ask questions or say you don't know or understand something.

No one knows everything, and there's no such thing as a stupid question.
