I started developing websites in HTML and CSS in 2007 before adopting PHP and Drupal in 2008.

Since then, I've used Drupal 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 to deliver applications for clients, agencies and in-house teams.

I also use Symfony and Laravel, as well as JavaScript, TypeScript and Vue.js.

## Here's the thing

There isn't one outright "best" programming language, CMS or framework.

It depends on the project and its requirements as well as the knowledge and experience of the team working on it.
