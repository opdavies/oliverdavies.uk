I've usually written user stories that follow this format:

As a...
I want...
So that...

You focus on the person who needs the task first, followed by what they want, and why they want it.

Lately, I've been re-ordering stories to follow this order:

So that...
As a...
I want...

What I like about this is that it focuses on capturing the "why" of the story first rather than at the end or maybe even forgetting it altogether.

What's needed and who needs it doesn't matter unless you also capture why it's needed.
