    I'm wondering whether I should still rename gray to gray when using Tailwind CSS...

[I previously wrote][0] about how to change `gray` to `grey` in Tailwind CSS.

So, instead of writing `bg-gray-200`, I could write `bg-grey-200`.

This would be the correct spelling, as I live in the UK.

But I recently realised that I don't change `text-center` or `items-center` when 'centre' would also be the correct spelling.

So, what value is there to renaming `gray`?

It adds inconsistency as it mixes US and UK English in this project and inconsistencies between different projects.

It doesn't match the CSS colour name.

And, if I'm working with others on a project, they also need to be aware of this as it's different from the default configuration and could cause some confusion and affect productivity.

Keeping it the default value would make it easier to work on, collaborate on and maintain.

Maybe, I'll leave it as `gray` in the future.
