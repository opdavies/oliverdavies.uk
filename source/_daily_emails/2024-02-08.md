    Have you tried architectural testing with PHPat, Pest or a similar tool? I have been for the past few days.

[In yesterday's email][yesterday], I mentioned parallel testing and speeding up your tests by running them in parallel.

Something else I've been experimenting with recently in architectural testing with PHPat.

For example, ensuring classes within a namespace are `final` or not, that Controller classes all extend `ControllerBase` and have the Controller suffix in their names.

Going forward, I'd like to ensure that each Drupal module only uses its own classes and is separated, as I recently had an issue where I deleted a class method in one module only to find it was used in a different module.

Here's what I have so far for my [testing course codebase][atdc]:

```language-php
final class ArchitectureTest {

  public function test_classes_should_be_final(): Rule {
    return PHPat::rule()
      ->classes(Selector::inNamespace('Drupal\atdc'))
      ->shouldBeFinal();
  }

  public function test_controllers_should_extend_ControllerBase(): Rule {
    return PHPat::rule()
      ->classes(Selector::inNamespace('Drupal\atdc\Controller'))
      ->shouldExtend()
      ->classes(Selector::classname(ControllerBase::class));
  }

  public function test_controllers_should_have_the_Controller_suffix(): Rule {
    return PHPat::rule()
      ->classes(Selector::inNamespace('Drupal\atdc\Controller'))
      ->shouldBeNamed(
        classname: '/Controller$/',
        regex: TRUE,
      );
  }

}
```

I plan to continue expanding this configuration as I become more familiar with PHPat, and because it's a PHPStan extension, it's already available to run within my projects locally and within the CI pipeline.
