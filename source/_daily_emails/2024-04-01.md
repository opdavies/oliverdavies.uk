On the 24th of April, I'll be attending a LocalGov Drupal Camp in Birmingham, UK.

As someone keen to get more involved and contribute more to the project, and who's [local council recently switched to LocalGov][newport], I'm looking forward to the chance to learn and contribute on the day and afterwards.

If you want to attend also, there are a few remaining tickets available and you can [register on Eventbrite][event].
