Deprecating code is a way of identifying code that will be removed in a future major version.

For example, the `drupal_set_message()` function was deprecated in Drupal 8.5 and removed in Drupal 9 as the `messenger` service replaced it.

Once it was deprecated, the function was changed to use the new service to avoid duplicating code and a message was added to notify Developers:

```language-php
function drupal_set_message($message = NULL, $type = 'status', $repeat = FALSE) {
  @trigger_error('drupal_set_message() is deprecated in Drupal 8.5.0 and will be removed before Drupal 9.0.0. Use \Drupal\Core\Messenger\MessengerInterface::addMessage() instead. See https://www.drupal.org/node/2774931', E_USER_DEPRECATED);

  $messenger = \Drupal::messenger();
  if (isset($message)) {
    $messenger->addMessage($message, $type, $repeat);
  }

  return $messenger->all();
}
```

This approach means that code can be refactored without breaking backwards-compatibility and, to upgrade any custom code to be compatible with Drupal 9, any references to `drupal_set_message()` just needed to be updated to use the new Messenger service.

No large rewrite needed!
