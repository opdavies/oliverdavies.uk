    I'm almost at 100 talks and presentations given!
---

[My talks page][talks] on my website says I've presented 98 talks and workshops at different events since September 2012.

Next month, I'm giving two talks at DrupalCamp Ghent.

One on [automated testing and test-driven development][testing] and another on [Tailwind CSS].

This means that these will be my 99th and 100th presentations!

I enjoy speaking at events such as meetups and conferences, and I hope people have learned from them as well.
