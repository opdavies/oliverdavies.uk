Does your team really do CI/CD (continuous integration and delivery)?

I recently watched a recording of a talk from another daily emailer, [Jonathan Hall](https://jhall.io), who started by asking the audience to raise their hands and keep them raised if...

* They did a release to production in the last week.
* They did a release to production yesterday.
* They do not have a permanent branch called `develop`.
* They do not have a special "hotfix" procedure.
* Every Developer on their team merged work into `main` yesterday.
* They have no pull requests more than 24 hours old.

## CI/CD is about process

This is an excellent way to highlight that CI/CD is about processes, not technologies.

Continuous integration is about how often everyone merges and pushes their changes, and continuous delivery and deployment is how you create releasable software and how long it takes for a change to get into production - not whether or not you use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI or Jenkins.
