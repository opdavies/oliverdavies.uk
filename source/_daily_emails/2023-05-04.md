After registering as an attendee, I've been upgraded to a speaker for next week's event and the first in-person Symfony UK meetup in two years.

I'll be speaking about my experiences so far with mob programming - something that I spoke about at a PHP South Wales meetup last year.

If you're interested and in London on the 11th of May, [find out more and register](https://www.meetup.com/symfony/events/293153957).

Also, Happy Star Wars Day!
