  How I use a `run` file within my CI pipelines.
---

[One of my earliest daily emails was about `run` files][0] - files that contain Bash functions that combine or simplify project-specific tasks.

In Drupal projects, these could be to execute Composer or Drush commands, connect to the database, or run automated tests.

For my CI pipelines, I like to use a function called `ci:test` that contains all the commands to run in the pipeline.

This keeps the pipeline configuration as simple and agnostic as possible.

It also makes it easy for people to read and, because it's a bash file, it will run anywhere without any additional tools.

For an example, [see my Drupal Docker example repository][1].

## Here's the thing

The main advantage, though, is being able to run the pipeline locally, if you need to.

Maybe you need to debug a failure in the pipeline or you want to test a change to the pipeline locally before pushing it.

By using a command in a `run` file, doing so is as simple as running that one command.
