I've seen a lot on social media and posts and videos recently about Laravel Pipelines - functionality that's been present in Laravel and used within the framework for some time - but there was only documentation added for it last month as part of the Laravel 10 release.

This is an example from the new documentation:

```php
$user = Pipeline::send($user)
    ->through([
        GenerateProfilePhoto::class,
        ActivateSubscription::class,
        SendWelcomeEmail::class,
    ])
    ->then(fn (User $user) => $user);
```

Once a user has registered, it is passed through different classes - each performing a task and calling the next class in the list, similar to middleware. Once finished, a final action is performed or a value is returned.

As someone who doesn't use Laravel often but does use standalone components - like `illuminate/collections` - in other PHP projects, I'm interested to see how I can use this via `illuminate/pipeline` to refactor some of my existing code.
