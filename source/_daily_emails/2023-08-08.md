Today, I was speaking with a colleague about configuring Git, which led to a conversation about dotfiles repositories - somewhere where you version the changes to your configuration files and, usually, create symlinks to their expected locations.

Afterwards, I realised the first commit to [my personal dotfiles repository](https://github.com/opdavies/dotfiles) was over eight years ago, in July 2015.

What started as a repository to put my own Git configuration has undergone various changes since the tools I use changed, as well as the tools to manage the files themselves.

In 2021, I switched my `.vimrc` configuration file to an `init.vim` and switched to Neovim full-time and, most recently, almost a year ago, I started to use the Nix package manager and later adopted NixOS as my primary Linux distribution.

My complete NixOS and Home Manager configurations are within my `dotfiles` repository, and the configuration for tools, including Neovim, tmux and Git.

I wonder what the repository will look like in another eight years...
