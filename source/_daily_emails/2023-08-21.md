The main part of my CI pipeline tasks are running the automated tests, coding standards checks and static analysis.

But which of these are the most valuable?

I used to run the coding standards check first as it was the quickest, followed by static analysis and the automated tests.

If a task were going to fail, it would fail quickly.

But is that the objective of the CI pipeline?

Whilst it needs to be quick, the main reason to run these is to ensure things work as expected.

Recently, I changed my pipelines to run the tests first, as these verify the code's behaviour.

I want to know if the code works but has a coding standard error that needs to be fixed rather than the pipeline failing on the error and not knowing whether the code works.
