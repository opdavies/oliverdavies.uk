    I contributed automated tests to the Content Access by Path Drupal module.
---

Back in [episode 11 of the Beyond Blocks podcast][0], my guest was Mark Conroy and we discussed various things including his [Running Plan Generator][1] and the [Content Access By Path Drupal module][2].

Written for the LocalGov Drupal distribution, as its name suggests, the module allows for setting permissions to maintain content based on its path.

I had a quick look at the module whilst recording and mentioned there were no automated tests, and I was invited to write and contribute some.

I did, [live on YouTube][3], and [created a merge request][4] for the module for review.

Today, that merge request was approved and the tests were added to the module, so I'm officially a contributor to that module.

I also added GitLab configuration, so the tests will automatically run for every change and help avoid regressions in the future.
