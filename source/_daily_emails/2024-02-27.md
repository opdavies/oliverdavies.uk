  Today, I started a design system with Symfony in a few hours, based on recent podcast episodes with Mark Conroy and Ryan Weaver.
---

[I recently spoke with Mark Conroy][mark], Director of Development at Annertech, on the Beyond Blocks podcast.
We discussed building something useful in a day and building design systems with web components.

Inspired by that conversation, I spent this afternoon experimenting with web components and seeing how I could use them within a design system we're building, as I think they can solve a particular need we have.

Following that, I thought I'd see how I could build my own design system and decided to do it with Symfony and see what I could achieve within a few hours.

It was a great opportunity to take Symfony 7 for a spin and explore and test some things that [Ryan Weaver and I discussed in our episode][ryan], such as Symfony UX and Twig components.

Each component is a Twig component with its own PHP class and Twig template, which is rendered when I visit its URL, and I can use the HTML-like `<twig:Logo />` syntax to include child components.

You can [view the code on GitHub][repo], and it may be something I use and work on in the future.
