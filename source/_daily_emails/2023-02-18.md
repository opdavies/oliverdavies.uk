Today, I reviewed [the issue and merge request](https://www.drupal.org/project/override_node_options/issues/3269901) to make the [Override Node Options](https://www.drupal.org/project/override_node_options) module compatible with Drupal 10.

It's a small patch that mainly affects the module's test suite so has a low risk of breaking the functionality of the module.

As well as the automated tests, I've done some manual testing with the patch applied on both Drupal 9.5 and 10.

The project page shows the module is currently used on over 34,000 sites including 18,565 Drupal 8 and 9 websites on the 8.x-2.x branch. Hopefully this number will continue to increase once the Drupal 10 version is released.
