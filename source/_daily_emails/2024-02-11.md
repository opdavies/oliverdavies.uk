This week's guest on Beyond Blocks is [Ryan Weaver][episode].

Ryan is a Symfony Developer, Symfony core team member and writer for SymfonyCasts.

We discussed recent developments in Twig templates, SymfonyCasts, release cycles, and similarities between the Drupal and Symfony projects and communities.

I've been a long-time subscriber of SymfonyCasts and it was a big help when I was learning Drupal 8 for Twig and object-orientated PHP, so it was great to speak with Ryan.
