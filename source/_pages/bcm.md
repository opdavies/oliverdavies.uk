Thanks for attending my talk on [Build Configs](/build-configs).

[These are the slides](/talks/building-build-configs) I presented and the example video:

{% include 'youtube-video' with { id: 'LkhsdmxReUc'} %}

From nothing to a working Drupal 10 website in less than a minute!

If you have any further questions, let me know.

## Can we work together?

[Get in touch](/contact) if you're interested in using Build Configs-based managed configuration files in your projects (I offer one-off implementations or ongoing updates via a subscription), you need an in-house tool built for your team, or if we can [work together another way](/pricing).

## While you're here

Why not join my [daily email list](/daily) or register for my [free email course](/atdc) on automated testing in Drupal?

Oliver
