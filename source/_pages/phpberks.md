Thank you for attending my Sculpin talk at PHP Berkshire.

[The slides and a previous recording](/talks/building-static-websites-sculpin) are on the talk page.

To see an example of a Sculpin project, you can see [the source code for this website](https://github.com/opdavies/oliverdavies.uk), [my Zettlekasten](https://github.com/opdavies/zet.oliverdavies.uk) or [my demo for PHP South West](https://github.com/opdavies/phpsw-sculpin-demo).

If you want to try Sculpin, you can use [the Sculpin Skeleton project I created](https://github.com/opdavies/sculpin-skeleton) as a starting point for new projects.

## Can we work together?

As well as building static websites with Sculpin, I do consulting and advisory work using other PHP projects - namely, Drupal and Symfony.

I offer [unlimited monthly Drupal consulting](/consulting), [1-on-1 consultation calls](/call) and [pair programming sessions](/pair) to get people unstuck, and fixed prices (not estimates) for development work.

## Are you stuck on Drupal 7, 8 or 9?

Drupal 7 will be end-of-life and no longer supported as of the 5th of January, 2025.

Drupal 8 and 9 are already unsupported.

If you have an outdated Drupal website and want to know more about upgrading to Drupal 10, [book your upgrade roadmap](/drupal-upgrade) and I'll help you get there.

## Stay in touch

The best way to stay in touch with me is my [email list](/daily) to which I send daily emails about Drupal and software development.

All emails are sent from my personal email address, so you can press reply and contact me directly.
