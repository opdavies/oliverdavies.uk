{# Pain #}

Drupal 7 will be unsupported on the **5th of January 2025**.
Drupal 8 has been unsupported since **November 2021**.
Drupal 9 has been unsupported in **November 2023**.

* Do you need to upgrade your website before it reaches its end-of-life date and is no longer supported?
* Are you worried about rebuilding your website and migrating your data to Drupal 10?
* Is all of your business logic embedded within your Drupal code, making it hard to upgrade?
* Do you rely on modules or themes that are no longer updated or don't exist for Drupal 10?

{# Dream #}

## What if you had a clear path how to upgrade your website?

* What if you had a recommended approach to upgrade your website to Drupal 10?
* What if you knew about potential issues ahead of time?
* What if you had a list of modules to use in Drupal 10, alternatives for any missing modules, and what functionality would need custom code?

{# Fix #}

## Drupal upgrade roadmap

An upgrade roadmap is a personalised audit of your Drupal website and includes details and actionable steps to upgrade it, including identifying potential blockers you might encounter.

{# 1st call to action #}

{% include 'button.html.twig' with {
  text: page.button.text ~ ' &rarr;',
  url: page.button.url,
} %}

## How does it work?

* After receiving payment, we will arrange an initial call to discuss your project.
* You share your source code and provide access to your website.
  * I'll need access to the source code for your website. Ideally, this is via GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or whatever online version control you currently use, but I can also audit a zip file of your Git repository.
  * I'll need a user account to access your website to review its configuration, such as content types, user roles, etc. You can delete this once the engagement is complete.
  * Alternatively, I can use an export of the database to get a local version of your site up and running. Ideally, this would be sanitised to remove personal information such as usernames, email addresses and passwords.
* I'll send you the document once it's complete for you to review.
* We'll arrange a follow-up call to go through it in detail and for you to ask any questions.
