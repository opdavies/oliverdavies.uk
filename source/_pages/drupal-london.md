Thank you for attending my session for the Drupal London meetup.

You can [view the slides and previous recording][slides] of the talk on this website.

If you want to learn more, I released a [free 10-day email course][course] on automated testing in Drupal and [live stream on YouTube][youtube]. Most recently, [I contributed tests to the Content Access by Path module][video].

## Can we work together?

Drupal, automated testing and test-driven development are some of my favourite subjects to teach.

If you want me to teach your team to do test-driven development, team training is included within my [unlimited monthly Drupal consulting][consulting].

## Stay in touch

The best way to stay in touch with me is my [email list] to which I send daily emails about Drupal and software development.

All emails are sent from my personal email address, so you can press reply and contact me directly.

I also host the [Beyond Blocks podcast][podcast] where I discuss Drupal, PHP and other software-related topics with people.
