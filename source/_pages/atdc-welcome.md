Hi. Thank you for registering for my Test-Driven Drupal email course.

Every email will be sent from my personal email address, so if you have a question about any email, press reply, send it to me, and I'll personally respond.

I'd also appreciate any feedback as you work through or complete the course.

Remember to check your inbox and confirm your email address to ensure you get the lessons.

In the meantime, why not [go to my daily email archive](/archive) and read some of my previous daily emails?

Found this page by accident? [Consider subscribing for the course](/atdc).
