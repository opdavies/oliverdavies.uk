faqs:
  -
    - Which versions of Drupal do you work on?
    - |-
      I only work on the latest supported version of Drupal core, which is currently Drupal %supported_version%.

      If you have an application that uses an older version, I'm happy to give you a custom fixed-price proposal to upgrade to Drupal %supported_version%.
  -
    - Does this include maintenance tasks, such as updating Drupal core and contrib modules and themes?
    - |-
      Yes, updates are included and will need to be prioritised along with other requests.

      My suggestion is to do them regularly to reduce the risk of an update breaking your application.
  -
    - Is there a limit to how many requests I can have?
    - |-
      No. Once you're subscribed, you can add as many tasks to your queue as you'd like, and they'll be delivered one-by-one.

      You can move requests around and set your own project priority to ensure your most important tasks are finished first.
  -
    - How fast will I receive my completed requests?
    - |-
        Of course no two user stories or requests are the same, and some take longer than others.

        However, you'll typically start getting code back from me within days of submitting an active request.

        Software development is an iterative process, so I will break big projects into smaller tasks and start sending work-in-progress for review, feedback, and iteration.
  -
    - Who are the Developers?
    - |-
      I am! I won't pass your work to Junior Developers or offshore teams. You work directly with me. Always.
  -
    - How do I request tasks?
    - |-
      After subscribing, you'll need to give me access to your GitLab or GitHub repository and issues board. From there, assign as many tasks to me as you like, in priority order.
  -
    - What if I don't like how something turned out?
    - |-
      Development is an iterative process. Unlike an agency that will charge you extra for change orders, you get unlimited revisions until you’re happy with the work.
  -
    - What if I only have a single request?
    - |-
      Your subscription renews on a monthly basis. If you only have a single request, you are free to cancel your subscription after the first month.

      You can always renew again in the future, if you have a new request!
  -
    - How does the bug free guarantee work?
    - |-
      If you discover a bug in any code I delivered, for up to 6 months after the end of your subscription, I will fix it for free.
  -
    - Do you have a refund policy?
    - |-
      Yes, of course. If you're unhappy with my work for any reason during your first month of service, just say the word, and I'll give you a full refund. No questions asked.

## You're already running my code in production

I've contributed code to Drupal core and written popular contributed Drupal modules and themes, PHP and JavaScript libraries, and Tailwind CSS plugins.

## How it works

### Make as many requests as you like

Unlimited user stories. Unlimited tasks. Unlimited repos. Unlimited services.

### You set the priority

You decide what's most important. Change priorities at any time.

### Get code in days, not weeks

I work on one active request at a time, and start shipping code in days. Bigger projects will be broken down into smaller parts.

### Satisfaction guaranteed

Great software is an iterative process. I'll keep iterating with you until you're completely happy with the results.
