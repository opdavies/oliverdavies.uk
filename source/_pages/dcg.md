Thank you for attending my session at DrupalCamp Ghent.

You can view the slides and previous recordings of my [Test Driven Drupal][] and [Tailwind CSS][] talks on this website.

If you want to learn more, I released a video of the [Tailwind CSS workshop][workshop] I gave for DrupalCamp Florida, and I've created a [free 10-day email course][course] on automated testing in Drupal.

## Can we work together?

Automated testing, test-driven development and Tailwind CSS are some of my favourite subjects to teach.

If you want me to teach your team to do test-driven development or build UIs with Tailwind CSS, team training is included within my [unlimited monthly Drupal consulting][consulting].

## Stay in touch

The best way to stay in touch with me is my [email list] to which I send daily emails about Drupal and software development.

All emails are sent from my personal email address, so you can press reply and contact me directly.
