Coming soon: a daily email course on building static websites with Sculpin.

If you're interested, why not [watch my Sculpin talk](/presentations/building-static-websites-sculpin) in the meantime or check out [the source code for this website](https://github.com/opdavies/oliverdavies.uk)?

If you want me to let you know once the course is ready, <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">send me an email and I'll add you to the list</a>.
