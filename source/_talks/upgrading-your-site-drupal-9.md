For most Drupal Developers and users, the idea of moving a project from one
major version of Drupal to another can be daunting, with modules and themes
having to being changed significantly or rebuilt completely, and data being
migrated from the old site to the new one.

This was no more so than the move from Drupal 7 to 8, but luckily this has
changed for Drupal 9 and an upgrade can be done with minimal changes and not a
data migration in sight!

In this talk, we'll look at some of the changes to Drupal's tools and processes
that have made this possible, and how to move your Drupal site to Drupal 9.
