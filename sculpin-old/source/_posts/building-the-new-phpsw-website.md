Earlier this week we had another hack night, working on the new [PHPSW user
group][0] website.

It’s built with Symfony so it’s naturally using Twig for templating. I’ve become
a big fan of the utility based approach to CSS and [Tailwind CSS][1] in
particular, so I’m using that for all of the styling, and using [Webpack
Encore][2] to compile all of the assets.

We have an integration with Meetup.com which we’re using to pull all of our
previous event data and store them as JSON files for Symfony to parse and
render, which it then uses to generate static HTML to upload onto the server.

We’re in the process of populating all of the past data, but look out for a v1
launch soon. In the meantime, feel free to take a peek at our [GitHub
repository][3].
