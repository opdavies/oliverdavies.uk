This week the latest minor version of Drupal 8, 8.5.0, was released.

> This new version makes Media module available for all, improves migrations
> significantly, stabilizes the Content Moderation and Settings Tray modules,
> serves dynamic pages faster with BigPipe enabled by default, and introduces a
> new experimental entity layout user interface. The release includes several
> very important fixes for workflows of content translations and supports
> running on PHP 7.2.

I’ve been very impressed by the new release cycle Drupal 8 and the usage of
semantic versioning. Though it adds a greater maintenance overhead for module,
theme, installation profile and distribution developers to ensure that our
projects are still working properly, having the ability to add new modules into
Drupal core as well as new installation profiles like the [Unami demonstration
profile][2] is pretty cool!

For example, in addition to Unami, 8.5 alone adds media in core, two
experimental modules have been marked as stable, an experimental new layout
builder has been added and lots of PHP 7.2 improvements have been committed to
make 8.5 fully PHP 7.2 compatible.

I’m already looking forward to see what’s coming in 8.6 later this year!
