[Reroute Email](https://www.drupal.org/project/reroute_email) module uses
`hook_mail_alter()` to prevent emails from being sent to users from
non-production sites. It allows you to enter one or more email addresses that
will receive the emails instead of delivering them to the original user.

> formatting, footers, ...etc.

As we don't need the module configured on production (we don't need to reroute
any emails there), it's best to do this in code using settings.local.php (if you
have one) or the standard settings.php file.

The first thing that we need to do is to enable rerouting. Without doing this,
nothing will happen.

```language-php
$conf['reroute_email_enable'] = TRUE;
```

The next option is to whether to show rerouting description in mail body. I
usually have this enabled. Set this to TRUE or FALSE depending on your
preference.

```language-php
$conf['reroute_email_enable_message'] = TRUE;
```

The last setting is the email address to use. If you're entering a single
address, you can add it as a simple string.

```language-php
$conf['reroute_email_address'] = 'person1@example.com';
```

In this example, all emails from the site will be rerouted to
person1@example.com.

If you want to add multiple addresses, these should be added in a
semicolon-delimited list. Whilst you could add these also as a string, I prefer
to use an array of addresses and the `implode()` function.

```language-php
$conf['reroute_email_address'] = implode(';', array(
  'person1@example.com',
  'person2@example.com',
  'person3@example.com',
));
```

In this example, person2@example.com and person3@example.com would receive their
emails from the site as normal. Any emails to addresses not in the array would
continue to be redirected to person1@example.com.
