It's all booked, I'm going to be attending
[DrupalCamp London](http://2014.drupalcamplondon.co.uk) this year, my first
DrupalCamp!

I'm going as a volunteer, so I'm going to be helping with the registrations on
the Saturday morning and for another couple hours elsewhere over the weekend.
I've also offered to help organise and oversee some code sprints, although I'm
definitely wanting to do some sprinting of my own and attend a few sessions.

I'm looking forward to meeting some new people as well as catching up with some
people that I met at [DrupalCon Prague](http://prague2013.drupal.org).

If you're also coming, see you there!
