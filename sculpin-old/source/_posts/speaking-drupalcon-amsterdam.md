<p class="lead" markdown="1">I’ve attended numerous <a href="http://drupalcon.net">DrupalCons</a> since my first in Prague in 2013, as a delegate, as a [{{site.companies.drupal_association.name}}]({{site.companies.drupal_association.url}}) staff member, and also as a contribution sprint mentor. I’m excited to be attending DrupalCon Amsterdam again this year - but as my first time as a DrupalCon speaker.</p>

The session that I’m going to be presenting is a twenty minute version of my
[Deploying PHP applications with Ansible, Ansible Vault and Ansistrano](/talks/deploying-php-ansible-ansistrano)
talk.

I’ve been working with Drupal since 2007 (or maybe 2008), and it was the subject
of my [first meetup talk](/talks/so-what-is-this-drupal-thing) in 2012. Since
then I’ve given <a href="{{ site.menus.main.talks.href }}">48 more talks</a>
(including one workshop) at various user groups and conferences on a range of
development and systems administration topics. So it’s a nice conincedence that
this will be my fiftieth (50th) talk.

Thanks also to my employer,
[{{site.companies.inviqa.name}}]({{site.companies.inviqa.url}}), who are giving
me the time and covering my costs to attend the conference.
