**Thanks to Bob at [Mustardseed Media](http://mustardseedmedia.com) for
[tweeting](http://twitter.com/mustardseedinc/status/14713096905) about this
module. It's undoubtedly saved me hours of work today alone!**

I've recently started a personal project converting a website to Drupal. It's
currently a static HTML/CSS site which also uses the
[Coppermine Photo Gallery](http://coppermine-gallery.net). As part of building
the new website, I wanted to move all the photos from the existing site onto the
new one. However, with 1260 photos in 17 albums, this could have been a lengthy
process!

I created a new Drupal-powered Gallery as described in
[this screencast](http://lullabot.com/articles/photo-galleries-views-attach) by
[Jeff Eaton](http://twitter.com/eaton) - using the CCK and Imagefield modules,
and re-created each of my existing Gallery nodes. Using the
[Imagefield_Import](http://drupal.org/project/imagefield_import) module, I was
then able to quickly import the photos into the new Galleries.

I downloaded all the photos from the previous Gallery via FTP, and installed and
configured the Imagefield_Import module.

I created an 'Import' folder, selected the target field and mode. In this case,
I want each image to be imported into its own Photo node. I moved the photos for
the first album into the Import folder, and loaded the 'Import Images' screen
<em>(admin/content/imagefield_import)</em>.

After clicking 'Import', a node is created for each photo, the image is
uploaded, and added to the selected Gallery.

Just another 1248 photos to go...
