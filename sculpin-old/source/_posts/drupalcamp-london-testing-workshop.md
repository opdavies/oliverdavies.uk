The subject will be automated testing and test driven development in Drupal 8,
and it will be on Friday 13th March 2020, between 1pm and 5pm.

In the workshop, I’ll cover the methodology, approaches and terminology involved
with automated testing, look at some examples and work through some exercises,
and then take a test driven development approach to creating a new Drupal
module.

There are also other workshops on topics including Composer, Drupal Commerce,
profiling, and chatbots.
