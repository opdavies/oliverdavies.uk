Hi, I'm Oliver Davies (aka [opdavies](https://www.google.com/#q=opdavies)). I’m
a {{ site.work.role }} at
[{{site.companies[site.work.company].name}}]({{site.companies[site.work.company].url}})
and a part-time freelance Web Developer, based in Wales, UK.

I’ve been a Developer since 2007 and specialise in using Drupal, Symfony and
Vue.js, though I also use other technologies including Laravel and Sculpin. I
use Ansible for server provisioning and application deployments.

I’m an [Acquia certified](https://certification.acquia.com/user/1647756) Drupal
8 Grand Master, and Webmaster and Documentation Maintainer on
[Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org). I was previously a Developer for the
[{{site.companies.drupal_association.name}}]({{site.companies.drupal_association.url}}).

I regularly [give talks](/talks) at user groups and conferences, and am an
organiser of the
[{{site.events.php_south_wales.name}}]({{site.events.php_south_wales.url}}) user
group.

I enjoy contributing to open source, and maintain a variety of different
projects. You can see these on my [Drupal.org]({{site.drupalorg.url}}) and
[GitHub]({{site.github.url}}) accounts.
