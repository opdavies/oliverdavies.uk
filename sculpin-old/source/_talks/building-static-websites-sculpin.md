[Sculpin][0] is a static site generator written in PHP. It converts Markdown
files, Twig templates and standard HTML into a static HTML site that can be
easily deployed.

This talk will cover a little of the background to Sculpin and what it is, and
then will move into some demonstrations of how to build a Sculpin site and what
it can do!

You can [view the full slides][1], including the embedded videos.
