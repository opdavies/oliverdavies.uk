From the [DrupalCamp London website](https://drupalcamp.london/session/out-box-initiative-update):

> Since the last DrupalCamp London, the Umami Demo install profile is now one of the options shown to anyone installing Drupal. But this doesn't mean we've finished.

> There are many existing Drupal features that we want to showcase, and new features stabilising with each minor release. Join the Out of the Box initiative leads Keith Jay (kjay) and Gareth Goodwin (smaz) for this session, where we'll talk about:

> - Where we are, and how we got here

- Our targets for inclusion in Drupal 8.7.0
- How you can help!
- Plans for the more distant future
