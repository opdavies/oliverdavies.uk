Like Adam Wathan and other Tailwind CSS users, I've rebuilt a number of existing websites and user interfaces with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), either for practice, to try out some new features, or for a demo for a talk where I like to have a relevant example for that audience.

I thought that I'd list them all here, and keep the list up to date for future reference. Most of them are [tagged on GitHub](/tailwind-repos), though I have been using [Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com) for the newest ones.

Here is the list (last updated in November 2020):

- [Bartik](https://rebuilding-bartik.oliverdavies.uk) (Drupal's default theme), built with Vue.js. I've also made a version using Alpine JS.
- [Acquia's hosting dashboard](https://rebuilding-acquia.oliverdavies.uk), built with Vue.js.
- [The WordPress 2019 theme](https://wp-tailwind.oliverdavies.uk), built for WordCamp Bristol 2019.
- [Symfony.com website](http://rebuilding-symfony.oliverdavies.uk), built for Leeds PHP meetup.
- [Bristol JS website](https://rebuilding-bristol-js.oliverdavies.uk), built with Vue.js for Bristol JS meetup.
- [Platform.sh's hosting dashboard](https://rebuilding-platformsh.oliverdavies.uk) - in progress.
- [Pantheon's hosting dashboard](/rebuilding-pantheon) - in progress.
