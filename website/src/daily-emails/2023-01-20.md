In my [Taking Flight with Tailwind CSS talk](https://www.oliverdavies.uk/talks/taking-flight-with-tailwind-css), I've described Tailwind as a CSS utility class generator. You write a configuration file that Tailwind reads and generates the appropriate classes.

Yesterday I mentioned the [PHP South West user group](https://phpsw.uk) website. It's a project that [I worked on in November 2017](https://twitter.com/opdavies/status/934488762276564993) and uses Tailwind 0.5.

For me, a big advantage of Tailwind was that once it generates the classes, they are ours. They aren't hidden within the framework or an npm package. We can see them, commit them to version control and keep them for as long as we need.

Even if the Tailwind CSS framework disappeared tomorrow (I hope it doesn't), I'd be able to continue using the styles that it generated, and my projects would continue to work and look the same.
