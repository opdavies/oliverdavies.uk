Are you a Drupal Developer who wants to learn about automated testing and test-driven development, or do you manage a development team that you'd like to train?

I've delivered large Drupal projects using automated tests and test-driven development for custom functionality, and maintain Drupal modules with thousands of installations whilst using their tests to ensure working code and prevent regressions.

I offer an interactive full-day workshop (previously presented at DrupalCamp London, and remotely for DrupalCamp NYC) that provides an introduction to automated testing in Drupal and how to utilise test-driven development - which I've updated specifically for Drupal {drupalVersions}.

## Contents

* What is automated testing, and why write tests?
* What types of tests are available in Drupal?
* Outside-in vs. inside-out testing.
* Configuring Drupal and PHPUnit to run tests locally.
* Exercise: writing tests for existing Drupal core functionality.
* Exercise: adding tests to an existing custom module.
* What is test-driven development?
* Exercise: writing a new Drupal module from scratch with test-driven development.
* Q&A
