Tonight was our September meetup for the PHP South Wales user group, where I ran a hands-on session on mob programming.

I created [a small slide deck](https://speakerdeck.com/opdavies/an-introduction-to-mob-programming) before we started a mob session with the group.

We worked on the FizzBuzz kata in PHP, using Pest for our automated tests.

We followed the Driver and Navigator model, with one person responsible for the typing and interpreting the instructions from the Navigators, and switched roles every ten minutes.

You can [see the code that we wrote](https://github.com/opdavies/code-katas/blob/1da5dd5a79bc7ca083c0c4216fc3b4b0854f623d/php/tests/FizzBuzzTest.php) on my code katas GitHub repository.

It was a fun experience and nice to code with some people who I hadn't coded with before.

We did some code kata sessions during our online meetups which also seemed to go well, so coding nights on katas or personal or open-source projects might be something that we do more of in the future.
