After giving my [Ansible and Ansistrano talk](/talks/deploying-php-ansible-ansistrano) in Amsterdam, I'm excited that another of my talks has been accepted for DrupalCon!

This year, my [TDD - Test-Driven Drupal](/talks/tdd-test-driven-drupal) talk has been accepted for DrupalCon Europe, will is being held online from December 8-11th.

I first gave this talk at DrupalCamp London 2017 and again a number of times over the last few years including at Drupal Developer Days in Lisbon and most recently for the North West (UK) Drupal user group in May. I've always had good feedback from it, and enjoy teaching others about testing and hopefully continue to inspire people to start writing tests themselves.

This is definitely one of my favourite topics. I've enjoyed updating and improving this talk over the years, and I'm looking forward to giving it at DrupalCon this year.
