In less than two months time, [DrupalCamp Bristol][0] will be back for our third
year! (July seems to come around quicker each year). This is this year’s
schedule and venues:

- 30th June - CXO (Business) day - [Watershed][1]
- 1st July - Developer conference - [University of Bristol, School of
  Chemistry][2]
- 2nd July - Contribution sprints - Venue TBC

Today we announced [Emma Karayiannis][3] as our Saturday keynote speaker, and
we’ll be announcing some of the other speakers later this week.

Not submitted your session yet? The [session submissions][12] are open until May
31st. We’re looking for talks not only on Drupal, but other related topics such
as PHP, Symfony, server administration/DevOps, project management, case studies,
being human etc. If you want to submit but want to ask something beforehand,
please [send us an email][4] or ping us on [Twitter][5].

Not spoken at a DrupalCamp before? No problem. We’re looking for both new and
experienced speakers, and have both long (45 minutes) and short (20 minutes)
talk slots available.

Not bought your tickets yet? [Early bird tickets][10] for the CXO and conference
days are still available! The sprint day tickets are free but limited, so do
register for a ticket to claim your place.

We still have [sponsorships opportunities][6] available (big thanks to
[Microserve][7], [Deeson][8] and [Proctors][9]) who have already signed up), but
be quick if you want to be included in our brochure so that we can get you added
before our print deadline! Without our sponsors, putting on this event each year
would not be possible.

Any other questions? Take a look at [our website][0] or get in touch via
[Twitter][5] or [email][11].
