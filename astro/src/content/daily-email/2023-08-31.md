If, for every change to a codebase, you need to create a topic branch, create a pull or merge request, and wait for it to be reviewed and approved - which can take days, weeks or longer - does that discourage you from making small changes?

If you spotted some unused commented-out code whilst working in a file and went to remove it or a variable that could have a better name, would you change it?

Alternatively, if you could make the change and know from a CI pipeline within a few minutes that everything still worked, would you be more likely to make the change and improve the code for yourself and the next person to work on it?
