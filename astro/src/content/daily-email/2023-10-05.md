Once you have a passing test and you're confident your code works as expected, what do you do next?

Do you keep refactoring and changing it, or is it good enough?

Do you need to extract additional classes and methods now, or as the test is passing, do you move on to the next task?

The main objective is to ship the change and for it to provide value to users, not to have a perfect or "gold-plated" solution.

Once it's shipped, because you have tests, you can confidently refactor it in the future.
