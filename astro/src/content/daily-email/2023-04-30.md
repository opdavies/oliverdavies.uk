Drupal 7, first released in January 2011, is now on version 7.97.

As things stand, it's supported until November 2023, which makes me wonder whether we'll see the first version of Drupal to get 100 releases.

It was originally supposed to be end-of-life in November 2022, I also wonder if it'll be extended again and whether it should be.
