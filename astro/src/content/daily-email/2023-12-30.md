  Has anyone told you "We've always done it this way." or "We've never needed to write tests before."?

  In my experience, these are two of the worst phases to hear from new development teams.

Two of the worst phrases I've heard when working with new development teams is "We've always done it this way" or "We've never needed to do this before".

Whether it's writing automated tests, using static analysis, having a CI pipeline or using a specific framework or tool, this mindset prevents experimentation, growth and improvement.

Instead, try to think about what benefits alternative approaches could offer and how they could improve any situations you're currently experiencing.

You don't need to do it forever. Decide on something you want to try on a trial basis and set an end date.

Then, when the trial is finished, you can decide if it achieved what you wanted, and if you want to continue with it.

Even if you don't continue with it, you still learned something by trying.
