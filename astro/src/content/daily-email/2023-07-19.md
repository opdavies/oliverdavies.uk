During a webinar I watched recently, someone described test-driven-development as clicker training for Developers.

Similar to when people want to train an animal, the short cycles and quick feedback loops make it easier to stay focussed as you work on a task, and the satisfaction of getting a test to pass, completing a feature, or refactoring some messy code is the reward.
