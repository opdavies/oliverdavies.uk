In December [I gave a talk at DrupalCon Europe](/blog/test-driven-drupal-presentation-drupalcon-europe) on automated testing and test-driven development in Drupal. At the end of each session, the attendees were shown a survey to complete and the results have just been released to the speakers.

Here are the results from my session, and I've included the screenshot of the graphs at the bottom of this post. I'd like to thank everyone who attended the session live, and those who left valuable feedback afterward.
