I'm happy to be presenting two talks remotely at this year's [CMS Philly](https://cmsphilly.org) conference (formerly [Drupaldelphia](https://www.drupaldelphia.org)).

The first talk is [Deploying PHP applications with Ansible, Ansible Vault and Ansistrano](/talks/deploying-php-ansible-ansistrano) at 1pm (6pm UK time) where I'll be doing an introduction to Ansible and show how to use Ansistrano to do deploy a Drupal 8 application.

The second talk is [Taking Flight with Tailwind CSS](/talks/taking-flight-with-tailwind-css) at 2pm (7pm UK time) where I'll show how to configure and use Tailwind CSS.

CMS Philly is happening virtually on Friday, May 1st via GoToWebinar.
