How to install and configure the
[Stage File Proxy](https://www.drupal.org/project/stage_file_proxy) module to
serve remote images on your local Drupal site.

As this module is only going to be needed on pre-production sites, it would be
better to configure this within your settings.php or settings.local.php file. We
do this using the `$conf` array which removes the need to configure the module
through the UI and store the values in the database.

```php
// File proxy to the live site.
$conf['stage_file_proxy_origin'] = 'http://www.example.com';

// Don't copy the files, just link to them.
$conf['stage_file_proxy_hotlink'] = TRUE;

// Image style images are the wrong size otherwise.
$conf['stage_file_proxy_use_imagecache_root'] = FALSE;
```

If the origin site is not publicly accessible yet, maybe it's a pre-live or
staging site, and protected with a basic access authentication, you can include
the username and password within the origin URL.

```php
$conf['stage_file_proxy_origin'] = 'http://user:password@prelive.example.com';
```
