[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) has been my text editor of choice
for the past few months, and I use it at home, in work, and on any virtual
machines that I run. So rather than having to manually re-enter my settings each
time, I thought that I'd document them here for future reference.

These preferences ensure that the code is compliant with
[Drupal coding standards](http://drupal.org/coding-standards 'Drupal coding standards on Drupal.org') -
using two spaces instead of a tab, no trailing whitespace, blank line at the end
of a file etc.

## Preferences

These can be changed by going to Preferences > Settings - User.
