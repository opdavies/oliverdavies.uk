How to open Sublime Text from the command line.

Paste the following code into the Mac OS X Terminal, assuming that you've
installed Sublime Text 2 into the /Applications folder.

```bash
$ ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/sublime
```

Now you can type `sublime <filename>` open a file or directory in Sublime Text,
or `sublime .` to open the current directory.

You can also type `sublime --help` to see a list of the available commands.
