faqs:
  - - Do you only work with Drupal development teams?
    - No. While most of my background and experience is with PHP and Drupal, many things I can help with aren't specific to any language or framework.

  # - - TODO: money-back guarantee

  - - I have another question.
    - No problem! Send me an email at <a href="mailto:oliver@oliverdavies.uk">oliver@oliverdavies.uk</a>.

Do you need an experienced Software Developer or Drupal expert to upskill your in-house team? Are they new to Drupal or want to make better use of best practices, such as automated testing and test-driven development?

Do you want to gain exposure by contributing to open-source software, like Drupal, but don't know where to start?

{/* Dream */}
