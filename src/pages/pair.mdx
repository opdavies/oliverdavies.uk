title: Pair program with me
---

I enjoy pair and mob (group) programming, so as well as [traditional freelance
services][0], I offer paid remote pair programming sessions where I'll work
with you on your own project via a Zoom call.

My experience is based around PHP, Drupal, Symfony, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS,
Ansible, Docker, clean code, automated testing, and test-driven development.

I also offer free sessions for open source projects.

To arrange a pairing session, [find an available time on my calendar][1].
