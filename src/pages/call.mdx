## How it works

- You book a 60 minute consulting call with me.
- Once payment is received, you’ll obtain a link to schedule a meeting in my calendar.
- The meeting will take place over Zoom.

<Button href={frontmatter.link} text="Book your call now" />

If you don’t find the call valuable, I’ll refund 100% of the cost.

### Typical subjects of interest include

- How to approach a new project or task.
- Help writing your first automated test or starting with test-driven development.
- Introducing static analysis or other code quality tools to your project.
- Automating tasks with Docker and/or Ansible.
- Help to fix a bug or some broken code.
- Reviewing your code and providing advice and suggestions.
