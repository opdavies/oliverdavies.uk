I have {numberOfYears} years of software development and Drupal experience, have worked for the Drupal Association, and am an <a href="https://certification.acquia.com/user/4540">Acquia-certified Drupal expert</a>. I also work with complementary technologies such as Symfony, Vue.js, TypeScript, Docker, and Ansible.
