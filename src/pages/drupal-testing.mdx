Are you a Drupal Developer who wants to learn about automated testing and test-driven development, or do you manage a development team that you'd like to train?

I've delivered large Drupal projects using automated tests and test-driven development for custom functionality, and maintain Drupal modules with thousands of installations whilst using their tests to ensure working code and prevent regressions.

I offer an interactive full-day workshop (previously presented at DrupalCamp London, and remotely for DrupalCamp NYC) that provides an introduction to automated testing in Drupal and how to utilise test-driven development - which I've updated specifically for Drupal {drupalVersions}.

## Contents

- What is automated testing, and why write tests?
- What types of tests are available in Drupal?
- Outside-in vs. inside-out testing.
- Configuring Drupal and PHPUnit to run tests locally.
- Exercise: writing tests for existing Drupal core functionality.
- Exercise: adding tests to an existing custom module.
- What is test-driven development?
- Exercise: writing a new Drupal module from scratch with test-driven development.
- Q&A

## Not 100% sure?

Here's a video where I implement some of these approaches by adding related articles to a custom blog module for Drupal 9 (narrated version coming soon).
