Do you need an experienced Software Developer or Drupal expert to upskill your in-house team? Are they new to Drupal or want to make better use of best practices, such as automated testing and test-driven development?

Do you want to gain exposure by contributing to open-source software, like Drupal, but don't know where to start?

{/* Dream */}

I offer team coaching on an ongoing monthly basis. You can sign up for as long as you need, and pause or cancel at any time.
