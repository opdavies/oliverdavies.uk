I'm happy to announce that the
[Accessible Bristol](http://www.accessiblebristol.org.uk) website was launched
this week, on Drupal 7. The site has been developed over the past few months,
and uses the [User Relationships](http://drupal.org/project/user_relationships)
and [Privatemsg](http://drupal.org/project/privatemsg) modules to provide a
community-based platform where people with an interest in accessibility can
register and network with each other.

The group is hosting a launch event on the 28th November at the Council House,
College Green, Bristol. Interested? More information is available at
