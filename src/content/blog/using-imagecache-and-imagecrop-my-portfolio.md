Whilst working on my own portfolio/testimonial website, I decided to have a
portfolio page displaying the name of each site and a thumbnail image. For this
Blog post, I'll be using a site called
[Popcorn Strips](http://popcornstrips.com) which I built for a friend earlier
this year as an example.

I created a content type called 'Project' with a CCK ImageField called
'Screenshot'. I created a project called
[Popcorn Strips](http://popcornstrips.com), used the
[ScreenGrab](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/1146) add-on for Mozilla Firefox
to take a screenshot of the website, and uploaded it to the project node.

I created a View to display the published projects, and an ImageCache preset to
create the thumbnail image by scaling and cropping the image to a size of
200x100 pixels.

Although, this automatically focused the crop on the centre of the image,
whereas I wanted to crop from the top and left of the image - showing the site's
logo and header.

I installed the [ImageCrop](http://drupal.org/project/imagecrop) module, which
add a jQuery crop function to the standard ImageCache presents. I removed the
original Scale and Crop action and replaced it with a Scale action with a width
of 200px.

I then added a new 'Javascript crop' action with the following settings:

- Width: 200px
- Height: 100px
- xoffset: Left
- yoffset: Top
