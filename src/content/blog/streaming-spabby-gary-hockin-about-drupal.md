I recently joined my friend and fellow [PHP South Wales](https://phpsouthwales.uk) regular [Gary Hockin](https://twitter.com/GeeH "Gary on Twitter") (aka GeeH, aka Spabby) on his stream to discuss one of my favourite topics, Drupal.

I've noticed that a lot of Developers within the wider PHP community have maybe used or looked at an earlier version of Drupal, like 4, 5 or 6, but not a more recent version, so this seemed like a good opportunity to discuss and demo some of the modern features and improvements in Drupal to Gary's mostly PHP focussed audience.

You can currently [view the video on Gary's Twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/689269586), or I've embedded it below.

We touched on the topic of decoupled Drupal, and we're planning a follow-up stream where we pair program and set up Drupal together with a front-end React application, which would be great fun!
