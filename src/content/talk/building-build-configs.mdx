"Build Configs" is a tool I've created for creating and managing customised per-project configuration files s such as Docker, Docker Compose, Nix Flake, PHPUnit, and PHPStan.

In this lightning talk, Iâ€™ll discuss why I created it, what problem it solves, more about what it does, and how it works.
