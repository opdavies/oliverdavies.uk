I'm a self-taught Developer who's been writing code since 2007, working with and contributing to open-source technologies. I've been a mentor at events like DrupalCon and for bootcamps, including School of Code.

I'm part of different open-source and tech communities, organised meetups and conferences, and have given nearly 100 presentations.

In this talk, I'll speak more about the communities I'm part of, my contributions, how I started, why I do it, and who benefits and how.
