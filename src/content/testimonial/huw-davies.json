His knowledge of Drupal and the wider infrastructure required to run a site was really invaluable.</p>\n<p>At the time, we were very new to Drupal, so it gave us a great platform to learn from and expand our own knowledge.</p>\n<p>He's the only external contractor that we've kept in touch with over the years, which goes to show how much we valued his input.</p>\n",
