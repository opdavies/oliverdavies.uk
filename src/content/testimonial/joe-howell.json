As an insurance provider, some of our products and services don't naturally fit within a traditional ecommerce journey - but Oliver has always been able to come up with innovative ways to leverage core Drupal functionality and develop custom modules to meet our needs. Friendly, flexible and diligent â€“ I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Oliver to anyone looking for a Drupal developer to progress their next project.",
