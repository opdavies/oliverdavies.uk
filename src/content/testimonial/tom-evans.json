I have done several Drupal sites using UberCart, but since it is deprecated, I chose to use Commerce.  I had searched, posted to forums, and other normal means to find answers to my problems, to no response and to no avail.</p><p>I got a referral to Oliver and scheduled an appointment to discuss the problems on a Zoom call.  After showing him via screen share where I was stumped, he offered different approaches to what I was doing, which I was fine with as long as it worked.</p><p>Once we solved the first problem, I was really elated and then focused on the second one, which was an easier fix.  So in a short period of time, both problems were fixed and tested.</p><p>I found Oliver was affable and easy to work with.  He has a strong work ethic and a desire to solve problems for his customers and can recommend working with him.  I think one of his strengths is to find alternative solutions to problems.</p>",
