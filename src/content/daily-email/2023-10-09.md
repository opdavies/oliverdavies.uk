I've recently updated my [Drupal Docker example project][project] to Drupal 10.1.5 and have been spotting new things.

From British English as my default option during installation, UX improvements to the admin pages, and developer settings such as Twig caching being configurable in the admin UI.

Something I've loved since Drupal 8 is the constant new features and iterative improvements being added to Drupal core.

I'm looking forward to finding more of these as I keep upgrading my Docker example project as well as others.
