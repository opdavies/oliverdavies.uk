Working on software development tasks is like going to the Dentist.

Releasing new features, bug fixes, dependency updates, and refactoring is better and less painful when done regularly.

Doing these changes in small and regular batches is less risky than less frequent and larger releases.

It's easier to identify the cause of any issues and correct course if things aren't going to plan.
