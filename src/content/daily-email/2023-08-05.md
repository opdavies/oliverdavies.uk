I recently saw a social media website taking over users' handles - renaming them so they can have the original.

There were similar issues a few years ago when a website put a paywall in front of articles written by its users.

I've written articles and tutorials for companies I've worked at that no longer exist as the companies have been acquired.

This is why I like to own and control my content. I still have my versions if a website shuts down or changes its settings.

There are a lot of options, including Drupal, that can help with this. It's easy to set up a new website and start publishing your own content.
