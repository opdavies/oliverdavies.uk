Since looking more into Astro, I was looking through the GitHub repository - specifically within the examples - and spotted a typo within the title of one of the examples.

Rather than leaving it, I decided to follow the "boy-scout rule" and submit a fix and leave the code in a better state than I found it.

The Astro repository is hosted on GitHub so I was able to fork the repository, fix the typo and create a pull request with a few clicks in the GitHub UI.

Contributing to open-source software - particularly if you're new to it - doesn't mean that you need to always add large and complex changes. Small changes such as fixing a typo, updating documentation, fixing a small bug, or adding additional tests are all valid contributions that improve open-source projects.
