I was reading a Twitter thread recently that [started with this tweet](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1594786089994067969).

TL;DR:

> "Measuring output (e.g. velocity) is a waste of time. It's outcomes you care about - customer happiness."

This is definitely something that I agree with.

I can't remember the last time I looked at an output burndown chart or a velocity score.

I'd rather focus on what outcomes have been delivered and adding value to clients and customers.

What features did we release, what bugs did we fix, and what impact and value did that provide?

What increased revenue or improved a customer's experience?

I may have a sprint or cycle where I only deliver one or two large tasks, but those are major features that have been requested, a bug affecting a user's experience, or a task that unblocks future tasks.

In that situation, my velocity may not be good and could be improved by working on multiple smaller tasks, but which outcomes provide the most value?
