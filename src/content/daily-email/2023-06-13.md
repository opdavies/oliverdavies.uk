Whilst it's probably impractical to feature flag every new feature or change to your application, considering it is something I do for each change.

If you find a bug after a feature has been released, if it's feature flagged, you can quickly disable it without needing to make a code change or release another version.

Instead of needing a rollback plan for a release and reverting to the previous version, it can be as simple as disabling the feature flag again to turn it off whilst the cause is investigated.

There is a maintenance overhead to adding a feature flag, and it can cause complexity by creating separate paths within the code but using feature flags gives a lot of benefits too.
