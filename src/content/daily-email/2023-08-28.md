Instead of a single Developer working individually on a task and submitting it for a code review once complete, try pair or mob programming.

As well as extra benefits, such as knowledge sharing and shared responsibility for the code, it's continuously reviewed and improved during the session.

Questions from "Why are we doing it this way?" to "What's the best name for this variable?" can be asked, and decisions and changes can be made in real time.

So, why wait until the task is complete and the code is harder to change to review it?

Why not have it reviewed as it's written?
