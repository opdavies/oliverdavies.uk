As of today, Drupal 9 is end-of-life and no longer supported.

## Why?

Drupal 9 relies on several other software projects, including Symfony, CKEditor, and Twig.

With Symfony 4's end of life, CKEditor 4's end of life, and Twig 2's end of life all coming up soon, Drupal 9 went end of life on November 1st, 2023.

## What do I do next?

There will be no further releases of Drupal 9 so you need to upgrade.

If you're stuck on Drupal 9, 8, or 7, get unstuck with a [Drupal upgrade roadmap][roadmap] and get directions how to upgrade to Drupal 10.
