After [previously looking at the LocalGov Drupal distribution](https://www.oliverdavies.uk/archive/2022/10/24/looking-at-localgov-drupal), today I added a LocalGov Drupal example to my [Docker Examples repository](https://github.com/opdavies/docker-examples/tree/main/drupal-localgov).

Based on the Drupal 10 example, the LocalGov Drupal example used Composer's `create-project` command to scaffold the project plus some additional configuration files such as the `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yaml` and a `justfile`.

A feature on my list is to add to both examples is to install Drupal automatically instead of opening the installation screen or having to run an install command. Once that's in place, it'll remove a manual step and allow people to see the application more quickly.

I have some issues for examples and enhancements to add within [the repository's issue queue](https://github.com/opdavies/docker-examples/issues) and would welcome any suggestions or questions.

For LocalGov itself, I hope to find more opportunities to use and contribute to it in the future.
