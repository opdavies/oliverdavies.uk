This week's guest on the Beyond Blocks podcast isÂ Niklas Franke - Digital Marketing Manager at Factorial.

Niklas was a fellow speaker at the recent DrupalCon conference in Lille - presenting multiple sessions, whilst Factorial were sponsors of the event.

In this episode, Niklas and I discussed his first experience of DrupalCon, presenting a session on contribution for non-technical Drupalers, the German Drupal community, what the Splash Awards are and how to organise your own event.
