In most cases, clients don't care which CMS, framework, CSS library or design patterns you use. Clients are focused on the business value that those tools can provide, such as increasing traffic or conversion rate to increase revenue or awareness.

Improving the load speed of a page is good, but what business value does that offer? Are customers more likely to make a purchase if the page is faster?

If you can build the same page with different CMSes or frameworks, and style it in the same way with different CSS libraries, is there a business case for one over the other, such as better maintainability or a quicker time to launch the application?

Can you ship a simple MVP sooner, and refactor to use design patterns later?

Instead of focusing on technologies, tools and strategies, focus on the benefits and business value they can offer.
