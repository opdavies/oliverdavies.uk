[Yesterday's email][yesterday] explained why your company should contribute to open-source software, but why should you contribute as an individual?

Most of the same reasons apply, such as gaining experience and improved knowledge from contributing.

As an individual, you can build your own reputation and personal brand.

You'll get exposure from contributions and involvement with initiatives, such as the Drupal admin UI improvements and other core initiatives, which look great on your CV and LinkedIn profile.

This could lead to better career opportunities and potential projects.

I've had paid development work directly from my open-source code contributions, as well as public speaking and event organising, so I can vouch for this.

Like companies, if you make money from open-source software - either a salary or from paid projects or courses - it's in your interest to contribute so the software you use is maintained and improved so it's the best it can be.
