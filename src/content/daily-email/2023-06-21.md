"Deployments" and "releases" are often used interchangeably but mean different things.

A deployment moves a change from one place to another, such as some updated code from a staging environment to production.

A release is when the change made is available to users.

They can happen at the same time, or you can use feature flags to separate them, deploying the code in advance, and the change is only released (or unreleased) by toggling the feature flag.
