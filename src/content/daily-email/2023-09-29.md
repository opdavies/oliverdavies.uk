Today, I refactored some code on a client's Drupal project I've been working on.

This is what the commit says:

So, it's not a small refactor.

As I worked on the custom modules needed for the site, I noticed that some common functionality was spread over multiple modules. This refactor moved that functionality into its own module, which is now a dependency of the others.

The code is better, and the responsibilities of the modules are clearer.

Whilst a large amount of those additions are adding test modules with test configuration, it's not a small refactor.

## Here's the thing

This is what it says at the bottom of the CI pipeline output:

> OK (79 tests, 565 assertions)

This is the same number of passing tests and assertions I had before I started the refactor, so I know the functionality still works.

If I didn't have those tests, I wouldn't have done the refactor.
