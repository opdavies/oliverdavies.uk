Are you responsible for creating and maintaining resources like GitHub repositories, DigitalOcean servers, Amazon S3 buckets and Cloudfront distributions or DNS records in Cloudflare?

Do you do that through the various web UIs?

I'd recommend looking into infrastructure as code tools such as Ansible, Terraform and Pulumi.

You can create, manage and destroy these resources by writing text files rather than clicking around in web UIs, which you can store and share using version control tools.

Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools are something that I use when working with infrastructure, whether it's for a client project or [a talk demo](https://github.com/opdavies/rebuilding-acquia/blob/4efe94398f4d8715d22ca677756beb36017d4e74/main.tf) (this uses Terraform to create an Amazon S3 bucket and Cloudflare distribution, link it to an SSL certificate and create my DNS records - all automatically).
