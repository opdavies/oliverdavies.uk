The [Drupal Meetups Twitterbot][0] is a small project that I worked on a few
months ago, but hadn't got around to promoting yet. It’s intention is to provide
[one Twitter account][1] where people can get the up to date news from various
Drupal meetups.

It works by having a whitelist of [Twitter accounts and hashtags][2] to search
for, uses [Codebird][3] to query the Twitter API and retweets any matching
tweets on a scheduled basis.

If you would like your meetup group to be added to the list of searched
accounts, please [open an issue][4] on the GitHub repo.
